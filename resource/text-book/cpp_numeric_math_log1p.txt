   Additional overloads (since C++11)
   Defined in header <cmath>
   template< class Integer >
   double      log1p ( Integer num );
   (A) (constexpr since C++26)
   1-3) Computes the natural (base e) logarithm of 1 + num. This function
   is more precise than the expression std::log(1 + num) if num is close
   to zero. The library provides overloads of std::log1p for all
   cv-unqualified floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since
   C++23)
   A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are
   treated as double.
   (since C++11)

Parameters

   num - floating-point or integer value

Return value

   If no errors occur ln(1+num) is returned.

   If a domain error occurs, an implementation-defined value is returned
   (NaN where supported).

   If a pole error occurs, -HUGE_VAL, -HUGE_VALF, or -HUGE_VALL is
   returned.

   If a range error occurs due to underflow, the correct result (after
   rounding) is returned.

Error handling

   Errors are reported as specified in math_errhandling.

   Domain error occurs if num is less than -1.

   Pole error may occur if num is -1.

   If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC
   60559),
     * If the argument is ±0, it is returned unmodified.
     * If the argument is -1, -infty is returned and FE_DIVBYZERO is
       raised.
     * If the argument is less than -1, NaN is returned and FE_INVALID is
       raised.
     * If the argument is +infty, +infty is returned.
     * If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned.

Notes

   The functions std::expm1 and std::log1p are useful for financial
   calculations, for example, when calculating small daily interest rates:
   (1 + x)n
   - 1 can be expressed as std::expm1(n * std::log1p(x)). These functions
   also simplify writing accurate inverse hyperbolic functions.

   The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as
   (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first
   argument num1 and second argument num2:
     * If num1 or num2 has type long double, then std::log1p(num1, num2)
       has the same effect as std::log1p(static_cast<long double>(num1),
                  static_cast<long double>(num2)).
     * Otherwise, if num1 and/or num2 has type double or an integer type,
       then std::log1p(num1, num2) has the same effect as
       std::log1p(static_cast<double>(num1),
                  static_cast<double>(num2)).
     * Otherwise, if num1 or num2 has type float, then std::log1p(num1,
       num2) has the same effect as std::log1p(static_cast<float>(num1),
                  static_cast<float>(num2)).

   (until C++23)

   If num1 and num2 have arithmetic types, then std::log1p(num1, num2) has
   the same effect as std::log1p(static_cast</* common-floating-point-type
   */>(num1),
              static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num2)), where
   /* common-floating-point-type */ is the floating-point type with the
   greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point
   conversion subrank between the types of num1 and num2, arguments of
   integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion
   rank as double.

   If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank
   exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate
   from the overloads provided.
   (since C++23)

Example

   Run this code
#include <cerrno>
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>
// #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON

int main()
{
    std::cout << "log1p(0) = " << log1p(0) << '\n'
              << "Interest earned in 2 days on $100, compounded daily at 1%\n"
              << "    on a 30/360 calendar = "
              << 100 * expm1(2 * log1p(0.01 / 360)) << '\n'
              << "log(1+1e-16) = " << std::log(1 + 1e-16)
              << ", but log1p(1e-16) = " << std::log1p(1e-16) << '\n';

    // special values
    std::cout << "log1p(-0) = " << std::log1p(-0.0) << '\n'
              << "log1p(+Inf) = " << std::log1p(INFINITY) << '\n';

    // error handling
    errno = 0;
    std::feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT);

    std::cout << "log1p(-1) = " << std::log1p(-1) << '\n';

    if (errno == ERANGE)
        std::cout << "    errno == ERANGE: " << std::strerror(errno) << '\n';
    if (std::fetestexcept(FE_DIVBYZERO))
        std::cout << "    FE_DIVBYZERO raised\n";
}

   Possible output:
log1p(0) = 0
Interest earned in 2 days on $100, compounded daily at 1%
    on a 30/360 calendar = 0.00555563
log(1+1e-16) = 0, but log1p(1e-16) = 1e-16
log1p(-0) = -0
log1p(+Inf) = inf
log1p(-1) = -inf
    errno == ERANGE: Result too large
    FE_DIVBYZERO raised
