   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class RandomIt >
   void sort_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last );
   (1)                                      (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
   void sort_heap( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );
   (2)                                      (constexpr since C++20)

   Converts the heap [first, last) into a sorted range. The heap property
   is no longer maintained.
   1) The heap is with respect to operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since
   C++20), and will be sorted with respect to operator<(until
   C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   2) The heap is with respect to comp, and will be sorted with respect to
   comp.

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * [first, last) is not a heap.

     * The type of *first is not Swappable.

   (until C++11)
     * RandomIt is not ValueSwappable.
     * The type of *first is not MoveConstructible.
     * The type of *first is not MoveAssignable.

   (since C++11)

Parameters

   first, last - the heap to be sorted
   comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
   requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
   less than the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

   bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

   While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not
   modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values
   of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
   (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is
   equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt
   can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):
   1) At most \(\scriptsize 2N \cdot \log(N)\)2N  log(N) comparisons
   using operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   2) At most \(\scriptsize 2N \cdot \log(N)\)2N  log(N) applications of
   the comparison function comp.

Possible implementation

               sort_heap (1)
template<class RandomIt>
void sort_heap(RandomIt first, RandomIt last)
{
    while (first != last)
        std::pop_heap(first, last--);
}

               sort_heap (2)
template<class RandomIt, class Compare>
void sort_heap(RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp)
{
    while (first != last)
        std::pop_heap(first, last--, comp);
}

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>

void println(std::string_view fmt, const auto& v)
{
    for (std::cout << fmt; const auto &i : v)
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9};

    std::make_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
    println("after make_heap, v: ", v);

    std::sort_heap(v.begin(), v.end());
    println("after sort_heap, v: ", v);
}

   Output:
after make_heap, v: 9 4 5 1 1 3
after sort_heap, v: 1 1 3 4 5 9

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 2444 C++98 at most \(\scriptsize N \cdot \log(N)\)N  log(N)
   comparisons were allowed increased to \(\scriptsize 2N \cdot
   \log(N)\)2N  log(N)
