   Defined in header <experimental/type_traits>
   template< class... B >
   struct disjunction;
                                               (library fundamentals TS v2)

   Forms the logical disjunction of the type traits B..., effectively
   performing a logical or on the sequence of traits.

   The specialization std::experimental::disjunction<B1, ..., BN> has a
   public and unambiguous base that is
     * if sizeof...(B) == 0, std::false_type; otherwise
     * the first type Bi in B1, ..., BN for which bool(Bi::value) == true,
       or BN if there is no such type.

   The member names of the base class, other than disjunction and
   operator=, are not hidden and are unambiguously available in
   disjunction.

   Disjunction is short-circuiting: if there is a template type argument
   Bi with bool(Bi::value) != false, then instantiating disjunction<B1,
   ..., BN>::value does not require the instantiation of Bj::value for j >
   i.

Template parameters

   B... - every template argument Bi for which Bi::value is instantiated
   must be usable as a base class and define member value that is
   convertible to bool

Helper variable template

   template< class... B >
   constexpr bool disjunction_v = disjunction<B...>::value;
                         (library fundamentals TS v2)

Possible implementation

template<class...> struct disjunction : std::false_type {};
template<class B1> struct disjunction<B1> : B1 {};
template<class B1, class... Bn>
struct disjunction<B1, Bn...>
    : std::conditional_t<bool(B1::value), B1, disjunction<Bn...>>  {};

Notes

   A specialization of disjunction does not necessarily inherit from of
   either std::true_type or std::false_type: it simply inherits from the
   first B whose ::value, explicitly converted to bool, is true, or from
   the very last B when all of them convert to false. For example,
   disjunction<std::integral_constant<int, 2>, std::integral_constant<int,
   4>>::value is 2.
