   Defined in header <cwchar>
   std::wint_t fgetwc( std::FILE* stream );
   std::wint_t getwc( std::FILE* stream );

   Reads the next wide character from the given input stream. getwc() may
   be implemented as a macro and may evaluate stream more than once.

Parameters

   stream - to read the wide character from

Return value

   The next wide character from the stream or WEOF if an error has
   occurred or the end of file has been reached. If an encoding error
   occurred, errno is set to EILSEQ.
