   (C++20)(C++20)

   constexpr auto synth-three-way = /* see below */;
   (1) (since C++20)
   (exposition only*)
   template< class T, class U = T >

   using synth-three-way-result =
       decltype(synth-three-way(std::declval<T&>(), std::declval<U&>()));
   (2) (since C++20)
   (exposition only*)
   1) A function object whose operator() behaves as the synthesized
   three-way comparison function. Equivalent to:
constexpr auto synth-three-way =
    []<class T, class U>(const T& t, const U& u)
        requires requires
        {
            { t < u } -> boolean-testable;
            { u < t } -> boolean-testable;
        }
    {
        if constexpr (std::three_way_comparable_with<T, U>)
            return t <=> u;
        else
        {
            if (t < u)
                return std::weak_ordering::less;
            if (u < t)
                return std::weak_ordering::greater;
            return std::weak_ordering::equivalent;
        }
    };

   2) The return type of the operator() of (1) (synth-three-way).

Parameters

   t, u - the values to be compared

Return value

   The compare result.
