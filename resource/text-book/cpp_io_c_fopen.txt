   Defined in header <cstdio>
   std::FILE* fopen( const char* filename, const char* mode );

   Opens a file indicated by filename and returns a file stream associated
   with that file. mode is used to determine the file access mode.

Parameters

   filename - file name to associate the file stream to
   mode     - null-terminated character string determining file access mode

File access flags

   File access
   mode string Meaning Explanation Action if file
   already exists Action if file
   does not exist
   "r" read Open a file for reading read from start return NULL and set
   error
   "w" write Create a file for writing destroy contents create new
   "a" append Append to a file write to end create new
   "r+" read extended Open a file for read/write read from start return
   NULL and set error
   "w+" write extended Create a file for read/write destroy contents
   create new
   "a+" append extended Open a file for read/write write to end create new
   File access mode flag "b" can optionally be specified to open a file in
   binary mode. This flag has no effect on POSIX systems, but on Windows,
   for example, it disables special handling of '\n' and '\x1A'.
   On the append file access modes, data is written to the end of the file
   regardless of the current position of the file position indicator.
   File access mode flag "x" can optionally be appended to "w" or "w+"
   specifiers. This flag forces the function to fail if the file exists,
   instead of overwriting it. (C++17)
   The behavior is undefined if the mode is not one of the strings listed
   above. Some implementations define additional supported modes (e.g.
   Windows).

Return value

   If successful, returns a pointer to the object that controls the opened
   file stream, with both eof and error bits cleared. The stream is fully
   buffered unless filename refers to an interactive device.

   On error, returns a null pointer. POSIX requires that errno is set in
   this case.

Notes

   The format of filename is implementation-defined, and does not
   necessarily refer to a file (e.g. it may be the console or another
   device accessible through filesystem API). On platforms that support
   them, filename may include absolute or relative filesystem path.

   For portable directory and file naming, see C++ filesystem library or
   boost.filesystem.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

int main()
{
    int is_ok = EXIT_FAILURE;
    FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
    if (!fp)
    {
        std::perror("File opening failed");
        return is_ok;
    }

    int c; // Note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
    while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) // Standard C I/O file reading loop
        std::putchar(c);

    if (std::ferror(fp))
        std::puts("I/O error when reading");
    else if (std::feof(fp))
    {
        std::puts("End of file reached successfully");
        is_ok = EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    std::fclose(fp);
    return is_ok;
}

   Output:
End of file reached successfully
