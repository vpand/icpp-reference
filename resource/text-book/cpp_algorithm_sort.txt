   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class RandomIt >
   void sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last );
   (1) (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class RandomIt >

   void sort( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
              RandomIt first, RandomIt last );
   (2) (since C++17)
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >
   void sort( RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );
   (3) (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class RandomIt, class Compare >

   void sort( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
              RandomIt first, RandomIt last, Compare comp );
   (4) (since C++17)

   Sorts the elements in the range [first, last) in non-descending order.
   The order of equal elements is not guaranteed to be preserved.
   1) Elements are sorted with respect to operator<(until
   C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   3) Elements are sorted with respect to comp.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * The type of *first is not Swappable.

   (until C++11)
     * RandomIt is not ValueSwappable.
     * The type of *first is not MoveConstructible.
     * The type of *first is not MoveAssignable.

   (since C++11)

Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to sort
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
   requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
   less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

   bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

   While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not
   modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values
   of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
   (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is
   equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt
   can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as last - first:
   1,2) \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N·log(N)) comparisons using
   operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   3,4) \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N·log(N)) applications of the
   comparator comp.

Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Possible implementation

   See also the implementations in libstdc++ and libc++.

Notes

   Before LWG713, the complexity requirement allowed sort() to be
   implemented using only Quicksort, which may need \(\scriptsize
   O(N^2)\)O(N2
   ) comparisons in the worst case.

   Introsort can handle all cases with \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot
   \log(N))\)O(N·log(N)) comparisons (without incurring additional
   overhead in the average case), and thus is usually used for
   implementing sort().

   libc++ has not implemented the corrected time complexity requirement
   until LLVM 14.

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <array>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

int main()
{
    std::array<int, 10> s{5, 7, 4, 2, 8, 6, 1, 9, 0, 3};

    auto print = [&s](std::string_view const rem)
    {
        for (auto a : s)
            std::cout << a << ' ';
        std::cout << ": " << rem << '\n';
    };

    std::sort(s.begin(), s.end());
    print("sorted with the default operator<");

    std::sort(s.begin(), s.end(), std::greater<int>());
    print("sorted with the standard library compare function object");

    struct
    {
        bool operator()(int a, int b) const { return a < b; }
    }
    customLess;

    std::sort(s.begin(), s.end(), customLess);
    print("sorted with a custom function object");

    std::sort(s.begin(), s.end(), [](int a, int b)
                                  {
                                      return a > b;
                                  });
    print("sorted with a lambda expression");
}

   Output:
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : sorted with the default operator<
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 : sorted with the standard library compare function object
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 : sorted with a custom function object
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 : sorted with a lambda expression
