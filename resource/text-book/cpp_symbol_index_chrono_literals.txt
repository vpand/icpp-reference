   This page tries to list all the symbols that are available from the
   standard library (date and time library) in the namespace
   std::literals::chrono_literals. The symbols are written as follows:
     * Function names with ().
     * Templates with <>.

Notes

   These operators are declared in the namespace
   std::literals::chrono_literals, where both literals and chrono_literals
   are inline namespaces. Access to these operators can be gained with:
     * using namespace std::literals,
     * using namespace std::chrono_literals, or
     * using namespace std::literals::chrono_literals.

   In addition, within the namespace std::chrono, the directive using
   namespace literals::chrono_literals; is provided by the standard
   library, so that if a programmer uses using namespace std::chrono; to
   gain access to the classes in the chrono library, the corresponding
   literal operators become visible as well.
