   protected:
   virtual int_type pbackfail( int_type c = Traits::eof() );

   This function can only be called if any of the following condition is
   satisfied:
     * gptr() is null,
     * gptr() == eback(), or
     * traits::eq(traits::to_char_type(c), gptr()[-1]) returns false.

   This function is called by the public functions sungetc() and
   sputbackc() (which, in turn, are called by basic_istream::unget and
   basic_istream::putback) when either:
   1) There is no putback position in the get area (pbackfail() is called
   with no arguments). In this situation, the purpose of pbackfail() is to
   back up the get area by one character, if the associated character
   sequence allows this (e.g. a file-backed streambuf may reload the
   buffer from a file, starting one character earlier).
   2) The caller attempts to putback a different character from the one
   retrieved earlier (pbackfail() is called with the character that needs
   to be put back). In this situation, the purpose of pbackfail() is to
   place the character c into the get area at the position just before
   basic_streambuf::gptr(), and, if possible, to modify the associated
   character sequence to reflect this change. This may involve backing up
   the get area as in the first variant.

   The default base class version of this function does nothing and
   returns Traits::eof() in all situations. This function is overridden by
   the derived classes: basic_stringbuf::pbackfail,
   basic_filebuf::pbackfail, strstreambuf::pbackfail, and is expected to
   be overridden by user-defined and third-party library stream classes.

Parameters

   ch - character to put back or Traits::eof() if only back out is
   requested

Return value

   Traits::eof() in case of failure, some other value to indicate success.
   The base class version always fails.
