   template< class... Args >
   void emplace( Args&&... args );
   (since C++11)
   (until C++17)
   template< class... Args >
   decltype(auto) emplace( Args&&... args );
                            (since C++17)

   Pushes a new element to the end of the queue. The element is
   constructed in-place, i.e. no copy or move operations are performed.
   The constructor of the element is called with exactly the same
   arguments as supplied to the function.

   Effectively calls c.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);.

Parameters

   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element

Return value

   (none)
   (until C++17)

   The value or reference, if any, returned by the above call to
   Container::emplace_back.
   (since C++17)

Complexity

   Identical to the complexity of Container::emplace_back.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <queue>

struct S
{
    int id;

    S(int i, double d, std::string s) : id{i}
    {
        std::cout << "S::S(" << i << ", " << d << ", \"" << s << "\");\n";
    }
};

int main()
{
    std::queue<S> queue;
    const S& s = queue.emplace(42, 3.14, "C++"); // for return value C++17 requi
red
    std::cout << "id = " << s.id << '\n';
}

   Output:
S::S(42, 3.14, "C++")
id = 42

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 2783 C++17 emplace returned reference, breaking compatibility with
   pre-C++17 containers returns decltype(auto)
