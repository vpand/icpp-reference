   static int_type eof();
   (constexpr since C++11)
   (noexcept since C++11)

   Returns a value not equivalent to any valid value of type char_type.

   See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for
   X::eof.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

    char_type  eof()
   char EOF
   wchar_t WEOF
   char8_t an implementation-defined constant that
   cannot appear as a valid UTF-8 code unit
   char16_t an implementation-defined constant that
   cannot appear as a valid UTF-16 code unit
   char32_t an implementation-defined constant that
   cannot appear as a Unicode code point

Complexity

   Constant.
