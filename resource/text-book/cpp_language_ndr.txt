   History of C++

   "No diagnostic required" indicates that some phraseology is ill-formed
   according to the language rules, but a compiler need not issue any
   diagnostic or error message. Usually, the reason is that trying to
   detect these situations would result in prohibitively long compile
   times.

   If such a program is executed, the behavior is undefined.
