   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   double atof( const char* str );

   Interprets a floating point value in a byte string pointed to by str.

   Function discards any whitespace characters (as determined by
   std::isspace) until first non-whitespace character is found. Then it
   takes as many characters as possible to form a valid floating-point
   representation and converts them to a floating-point value. The valid
   floating-point value can be one of the following:
     * decimal floating-point expression. It consists of the following
       parts:

          + (optional) plus or minus sign
          + nonempty sequence of decimal digits optionally containing
            decimal-point character (as determined by the current C
            locale) (defines significand)
          + (optional) e or E followed with optional minus or plus sign
            and nonempty sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent to
            base 10)

     * hexadecimal floating-point expression. It consists of the following
       parts:

          + (optional) plus or minus sign
          + 0x or 0X
          + nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits optionally containing
            a decimal-point character (as determined by the current C
            locale) (defines significand)
          + (optional) p or P followed with optional minus or plus sign
            and nonempty sequence of decimal digits (defines exponent to
            base 2)

     * infinity expression. It consists of the following parts:

          + (optional) plus or minus sign
          + INF or INFINITY ignoring case

     * not-a-number expression. It consists of the following parts:

          + (optional) plus or minus sign
          + NAN or NAN(char_sequence) ignoring case of the NAN part.
            char_sequence can only contain digits, Latin letters, and
            underscores. The result is a quiet NaN floating-point value.

   (since C++11)
     * any other expression that may be accepted by the currently
       installed C locale

Parameters

   str - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be interpreted

Return value

   double value corresponding to the contents of str on success. If the
   converted value falls out of range of the return type, the return value
   is undefined. If no conversion can be performed, 0.0 is returned.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << std::atof("0.0000000123") << '\n'
              << std::atof("0.012") << '\n'
              << std::atof("15e16") << '\n'
              << std::atof("-0x1afp-2") << '\n'
              << std::atof("inF") << '\n'
              << std::atof("Nan") << '\n'
              << std::atof("invalid") << '\n';
}

   Output:
1.23e-08
0.012
1.5e+17
-107.75
inf
nan
0
