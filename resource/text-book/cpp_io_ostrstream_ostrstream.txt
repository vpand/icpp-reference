   ostrstream();
   (1) (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)
   ostrstream( char* s, int n, std::ios_base::openmode mode =
   std::ios_base::out );
   (2) (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   Constructs new output strstream and its underlying std::strstreambuf.
   1) Default-constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf, which creates a
   dynamically growing buffer, and initializes the base class with the
   address of the strstreambuf member.
   2) Initialized the base class with the address of the underlying
   std::strstreambuf member, which is initialized in one of the two
   possible ways, both of which write to user-provided fixed-size array:
   a) if the app bit is not set in mode, constructs the buffer by calling
   strstreambuf(s, n, s). The behavior is undefined if there are less than
   n elements in the array whose first element is pointed to by s
   b) if the app bit is set in mode, constructs the buffer by calling
   strstreambuf(s, n, s + std::strlen(s)). The behavior is undefined if
   there are less than n elements in the array whose first element is
   pointed to by s or if the array does not contain a valid
   null-terminated character sequence.

Parameters

   s - char array to use as the output buffer
   n - size of the array to be used as the output buffer
   mode - specifies stream open mode. It is a bitmask type, the following
   constants are defined (although only app is used):
   Constant          Explanation
   app               seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary            open in binary mode
   in                open for reading
   out               open for writing
   trunc             discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate               seek to the end of stream immediately after open
   noreplace (C++23) open in exclusive mode

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    std::ostrstream s1; // dynamic buffer
    s1 << 1 << ' ' << 3.14 << " example\n" << std::ends;
    std::cout << s1.str();
    s1.freeze(false);

    char arr[15] = "Hello";

    std::ostrstream s2(arr, sizeof arr, std::ios_base::app);
    s2 << ", world!" << std::ends;
    std::cout << s2.str() << '\n';
    std::cout << arr << '\n'; // streams use the provided arrays
}

   Output:
1 3.14 example
Hello, world!
Hello, world!
