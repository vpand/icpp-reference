   Executes a statement repeatedly until the value of the condition
   expression becomes false. The test takes place after each iteration.

Syntax

   attr-spec-seq(optional) do statement while ( expression ) ;
   expression - any expression of scalar type. This expression is
   evaluated after each iteration, and if it compares equal to zero, the
   loop is exited.
   statement - any statement, typically a compound statement, which is the
   body of the loop
   attr-spec-seq - (C23)optional list of attributes, applied to the loop
   statement

Explanation

   A do-while statement causes the statement (also called the loop body)
   to be executed repeatedly until the expression (also called controlling
   expression) compares equal to 0. The repetition occurs regardless of
   whether the loop body is entered normally or by a goto into the middle
   of statement.

   The evaluation of expression takes place after each execution of
   statement (whether entered normally or by a goto). If the controlling
   expression needs to be evaluated before the loop body, the while loop
   or the for loop may be used.

   If the execution of the loop needs to be terminated at some point,
   break statement can be used as terminating statement.

   If the execution of the loop needs to be continued at the end of the
   loop body, continue statement can be used as a shortcut.

   A program with an endless loop has undefined behavior if the loop has
   no observable behavior (I/O, volatile accesses, atomic or
   synchronization operation) in any part of its statement or expression.
   This allows the compilers to optimize out all unobservable loops
   without proving that they terminate. The only exceptions are the loops
   where expression is a constant expression; do {...} while(true); is
   always an endless loop.

   As with all other selection and iteration statements, the do-while
   statement establishes block scope: any identifier introduced in the
   expression goes out of scope after the statement.
   (since C99)

Notes

   Boolean and pointer expressions are often used as loop controlling
   expressions. The boolean value false and the null pointer value of any
   pointer type compare equal to zero.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
enum { SIZE = 8 };
int main(void)
{
    // trivial example
    int array[SIZE], n = 0;
    do array[n++] = rand() % 2; // the loop body is a single expression statemen
t
    while(n < SIZE);
    puts("Array filled!");
    n = 0;
    do { // the loop body is a compound statement
        printf("%d ", array[n]);
        ++n;
    } while (n < SIZE);
    printf("\n");

    // the loop from K&R itoa(). The do-while loop is used
    // because there is always at least one digit to generate
    int num = 1234, i=0;
    char s[10];
    do s[i++] = num % 10 + '0'; // get next digit in reverse order
    while ((num /= 10) > 0);
    s[i] = '\0';
    puts(s);
}

   Possible output:
Array filled!
1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0
