   Defined in header <regex>
   template< class CharT >
   class regex_traits;
                            (since C++11)

   The type trait template regex_traits supplies std::basic_regex with the
   set of types and functions necessary to operate on the type CharT.

   Since many of regex operations are locale-sensitive (when
   std::regex_constants::collate flag is set), the regex_traits class
   typically holds an instance of a std::locale as a private member.

Standard specializations

   Two specializations of std::regex_traits are defined by the standard
   library:
   std::regex_traits<char>
   std::regex_traits<wchar_t>

   These specializations make it possible to use std::basic_regex<char>
   (aka std::regex) and std::basic_regex<wchar_t> (aka std::wregex). To
   use std::basic_regex with other character types (for example,
   char32_t), a user-provided trait class must be used.

Member types

   Type Definition
   char_type CharT
   string_type std::basic_string<CharT>
   locale_type The locale used for localized behavior in the regular
   expression. Must be CopyConstructible
   char_class_type Represents a character classification and is capable of
   holding an implementation specific set returned by lookup_classname.
   Must be a BitmaskType.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs the regex_traits object
   (public member function)
   length
   [static]
   calculates the length of a null-terminated character string
   (public static member function)
   translate
   determines the equivalence key for a character
   (public member function)
   translate_nocase
   determines the case-insensitive equivalence key for a character
   (public member function)
   transform
   determines the sort key for the given string, used to provide collation
   order
   (public member function)
   transform_primary
   determines the primary sort key for the character sequence, used to
   determine equivalence class
   (public member function)
   lookup_collatename
