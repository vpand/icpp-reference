   void clear();
                (noexcept since C++11)

   Erases all elements from the container. After this call, size() returns
   zero.

   Invalidates any references, pointers, and iterators referring to
   contained elements. Any past-the-end iterators are also invalidated.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)

Complexity

   Linear in the size of the container, i.e., the number of elements.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <deque>

void print_info(std::string_view rem, const std::deque<int>& v)
{
    std::cout << rem << "{ ";
    for (const auto& value : v)
        std::cout << value << ' ';
    std::cout << "}\n";
    std::cout << "Size=" << v.size() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::deque<int> container{1, 2, 3};
    print_info("Before clear: ", container);
    container.clear();
    print_info("After clear: ", container);
}

   Output:
Before clear: { 1 2 3 }
Size=3
After clear: { }
Size=0

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 2231 C++11 complexity guarantee was mistakenly omitted in C++11
   complexity reaffirmed as linear
