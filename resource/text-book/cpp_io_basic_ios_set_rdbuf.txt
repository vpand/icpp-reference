   (C++11)

   protected:
   void set_rdbuf( std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>* sb );
             (since C++11)

   Sets the associated stream buffer to sb without clearing the error
   state.

   This member function is protected: it is called by the move
   constructors of the derived streams such as std::basic_ofstream or
   std::basic_istringstream, as the final step after constructing the base
   class and after moving the stream buffer: only the most derived stream
   class knows how to correctly move the stream buffer, but std::basic_ios
   needs to be made aware of the stream's new location so that its public
   member functions can access it.

Parameters

   sb - stream buffer to associate to

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   Throws nothing.
