   template< container-compatible-range<T> R >
   constexpr iterator insert_range( const_iterator pos, R&& rg );
                                              (since C++23)

   Inserts, in non-reversing order, copies of elements in rg before pos.

   If after the operation the new size() is greater than old capacity() a
   reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the
   end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated.
   Otherwise, only the iterators and references before the insertion point
   remain valid.

   Each iterator in the range rg is dereferenced exactly once.

   The behavior is undefined if rg overlaps with the container.

Parameters

   pos - iterator before which the content will be inserted (pos may be
   the end() iterator)
   rg - a container compatible range, that is, an input_range whose
   elements are convertible to T
   Type requirements
   -
   T must be EmplaceConstructible into vector from *ranges::begin(rg).
   Also, T must be MoveInsertable into vector and T satisfies
   MoveConstructible, MoveAssignable, and Swappable. Otherwise, the
   behavior is undefined.

Return value

   An iterator that points at the copy of the first element inserted into
   vector or at pos if rg is empty.

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>
#include <list>

int main()
{
    auto container = std::vector{1, 2, 3, 4};
    auto pos = std::next(container.begin(), 2);
    assert(*pos == 3);
    const auto rg = std::list{-1, -2, -3};

#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    container.insert_range(pos, rg);
#else
    container.insert(pos, rg.cbegin(), rg.cend());
#endif
    assert(std::ranges::equal(container, std::vector{1, 2, -1, -2, -3, 3, 4}));
}
