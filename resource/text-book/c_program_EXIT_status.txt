   Defined in header <stdlib.h>
   #define EXIT_SUCCESS /*implementation defined*/
   #define EXIT_FAILURE /*implementation defined*/

   The EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE macros expand into integral
   expressions that can be used as arguments to the exit function (and,
   therefore, as the values to return from the main function), and
   indicate program execution status.
   Constant     Explanation
   EXIT_SUCCESS successful execution of a program
   EXIT_FAILURE unsuccessful execution of a program

Notes

   Both EXIT_SUCCESS and the value zero indicate successful program
   execution status (see exit), although it is not required that
   EXIT_SUCCESS equals zero.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    FILE *fp = fopen("data.txt","r");
    if (fp == NULL)
    {
       fprintf(stderr, "fopen() failed in file %s at line # %d", __FILE__,__LINE
__);
       exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    /* Normal processing continues here. */
    fclose(fp);
    printf("Normal Return\n");

    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

   Output:
fopen() failed in file main.cpp at line # 9
