   Defined in header <cmath>
   #define HUGE_VALF /* implementation defined */
                                                 (since C++11)
   #define HUGE_VAL  /* implementation defined */
   #define HUGE_VALL /* implementation defined */
                                                 (since C++11)

   The macros HUGE_VALF, HUGE_VAL and HUGE_VALL macros expand to positive
   floating point constant expressions which compare equal to the values
   returned by floating-point functions and operators in case of overflow
   (see math_errhandling).
   Constant Explanation
   HUGE_VALF Expands to positive float expression that indicates overflow
   HUGE_VAL Expands to positive double expression that indicates overflow,
   not necessarily representable as a float
   HUGE_VALL Expands to positive long double expression that indicates
   overflow, not necessarily representable as a float or double

   On implementations that support floating-point infinities, these macros
   always expand to the positive infinities of float, double, and long
   double, respectively.

Notes

   On implementations that do not support floating-point infinities, these
   macros expand to the maximum finite number of their respective types.

   C++98 added float and long double overloads of mathematical functions.
   There is a problem that the float overloads cannot return HUGE_VAL to
   indicate overflow because this macro is not guaranteed to be
   representable as a float.

   LWG issue 357 was raised to target this problem. LWG found that C99 has
   the same problem (float and long double overloads were also added in
   C99), and C99 introduced new macros HUGE_VALF and HUGE_VALL to solve
   the problem. Therefore the issue was closed and the C99 resolution was
   adopted in C++11.
