   Defined in header <filesystem>
   void rename( const std::filesystem::path& old_p,
                const std::filesystem::path& new_p );
   (1)                                             (since C++17)
   void rename( const std::filesystem::path& old_p,

                const std::filesystem::path& new_p,
                std::error_code& ec ) noexcept;
   (2)                                             (since C++17)

   Moves or renames the filesystem object identified by old_p to new_p as
   if by the POSIX rename:
     * If old_p is a non-directory file, then new_p must be one of:

          + the same file as old_p or a hardlink to it: nothing is done in
            this case.
          + existing non-directory file: new_p is first deleted, then,
            without allowing other processes to observe new_p as deleted,
            the pathname new_p is linked to the file and old_p is unlinked
            from the file. Write permissions are required to both the
            directory that contains old_p and the directory that contains
            new_p.
          + non-existing file in an existing directory: The pathname new_p
            is linked to the file and old_p is unlinked from the file.
            Write permissions are required to both the directory that
            contains old_p and the directory that contains new_p.

     * If old_p is a directory, then new_p must be one of:

          + the same directory as old_p or a hardlink to it: nothing is
            done in this case.
          + existing directory: new_p is deleted if empty on POSIX
            systems, but this may be an error on other systems. If not an
            error, then new_p is first deleted, then, without allowing
            other processes to observe new_p as deleted, the pathname
            new_p is linked to the directory and old_p is unlinked from
            the directory. Write permissions are required to both the
            directory that contains old_p and the directory that contains
            new_p.
          + non-existing directory, not ending with a directory separator,
            and whose parent directory exists: The pathname new_p is
            linked to the directory and old_p is unlinked from the
            directory. Write permissions are required to both the
            directory that contains old_p and the directory that contains
            new_p.

     * Symlinks are not followed: if old_p is a symlink, it is itself
       renamed, not its target. If new_p is an existing symlink, it is
       itself erased, not its target.

   Rename fails if
     * new_p ends with dot or with dot-dot.
     * new_p names a non-existing directory ending with a directory
       separator.
     * old_p is a directory which is an ancestor of new_p.

Parameters

   old_p - path to move or rename
   new_p - target path for the move/rename operation
   ec    - out-parameter for error reporting in the non-throwing overload

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   Any overload not marked noexcept may throw std::bad_alloc if memory
   allocation fails.
   1) Throws std::filesystem::filesystem_error on underlying OS API
   errors, constructed with old_p as the first path argument, new_p as the
   second path argument, and the OS error code as the error code argument.
   2) Sets a std::error_code& parameter to the OS API error code if an OS
   API call fails, and executes ec.clear() if no errors occur.

Example

   Run this code
#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main()
{
    std::filesystem::path p = std::filesystem::current_path() / "sandbox";
    std::filesystem::create_directories(p / "from");
    std::ofstream{ p / "from/file1.txt" }.put('a');
    std::filesystem::create_directory(p / "to");

//  fs::rename(p / "from/file1.txt", p / "to/"); // error: "to" is a directory
    fs::rename(p / "from/file1.txt", p / "to/file2.txt"); // OK
//  fs::rename(p / "from", p / "to"); // error: "to" is not empty
    fs::rename(p / "from", p / "to/subdir"); // OK

    std::filesystem::remove_all(p);
}
