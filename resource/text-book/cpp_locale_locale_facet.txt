   Defined in header <locale>
   class locale::facet;

   std::locale::facet is the base class for facets. It provides a common
   base class so that locales could store pointers to the facets they
   implement in a single indexed container, and it abstracts support for
   facet reference counting.

   Whenever a facet is added to a locale, the locale increments the
   reference count in the facet (through an implementation-specific
   mechanism). Whenever a locale is destructed or modified, it decrements
   the reference count in each facet it no longer implements. Whenever a
   facet's reference count becomes zero, the locale performs delete
   static_cast<std::locale::facet*>(f); where f is the pointer to the
   facet.

Facet class

   A class is a facet if
     * it is publicly derived from another facet, or
     * it is a class derived from std::locale::facet and contains a
       publicly accessible declaration as follows:

   static ::std::locale::id id;

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new facet with specified reference count
   (protected member function)
   operator=
   the copy assignment operator is deleted
   (protected member function)
   (destructor)
   [virtual]
   the destructor is protected virtual
   (virtual protected member function)
