   Defined in header <locale>
   bool operator==( const locale& other ) const;
   (1)
   bool operator!=( const locale& other ) const;
   (2)                                          (until C++20)

   Tests two locales for equality. Named locales are considered equal if
   their names are equal. Unnamed locales are considered equal if they are
   copies of each other.

   The != operator is synthesized from operator==.
   (since C++20)

Parameters

   other - a std::locale object to compare

Return value

   1) true if other is a copy of *this or has an identical name, false
   otherwise.
   2) false if other is a copy of *this or has an identical name, true
   otherwise.
