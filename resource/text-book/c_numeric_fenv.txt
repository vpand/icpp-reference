   The floating-point environment is the set of floating-point status
   flags and control modes supported by the implementation. It is
   thread-local, each thread inherits the initial state of its
   floating-point environment from the parent thread. Floating-point
   operations modify the floating-point status flags to indicate abnormal
   results or auxiliary information. The state of floating-point control
   modes affects the outcomes of some floating-point operations.

   The floating-point environment access and modification is only
   meaningful when #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS is set to ON. Otherwise the
   implementation is free to assume that floating-point control modes are
   always the default ones and that floating-point status flags are never
   tested or modified. In practice, few current compilers, such as HP aCC,
   Oracle Studio, and IBM XL, support the #pragma explicitly, but most
   compilers allow meaningful access to the floating-point environment
   anyway.

Types

   Defined in header <fenv.h>
   fenv_t The type representing the entire floating-point environment
   fexcept_t The type representing all floating-point status flags
   collectively
