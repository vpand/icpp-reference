   explicit flex_barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads );
   (1)                                                 (concurrency TS)
   template< class F >
   flex_barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads, F completion );
   (2)                                                 (concurrency TS)
   flex_barrier( const flex_barrier & ) = delete;

   1) Has the same effect as flex_barrier(num_threads, c), where c is a
   Callable object whose invocation returns -1 and has no side effects.
   2) Constructs a flex_barrier for num_threads participating threads,
   using completion for the completion phase. The set of participating
   threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at the
   synchronization point.
   3) Copy constructor is deleted; flex_barrier is not copyable.

Parameters

   num_threads - the number of participating threads for the flex_barrier;
   must be non-negative
   completion - a function object controlling the completion phase; must
   be Callable with no arguments and return type std::ptrdiff_t, and when
   invoked, must return a value no less than -1 and must not throw an
   exception
   Type requirements
   -
   F must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible.

Notes

   If num_threads is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and
   flex_barrier can only be destroyed.
