   protected:
   void init( std::basic_streambuf<CharT,Traits>* sb );

   Sets the associated stream buffer to sb and initializes the internal
   state.

   The postconditions are as follows:
     Element                            Value
   rdbuf()      sb
   tie()        null pointer
   rdstate()    goodbit if sb is not a null pointer, otherwise badbit
   exceptions() goodbit
   flags()      skipws | dec
   width()      0
   precision()  6
   fill()       widen(' ')
   getloc()     a copy of the value returned by std::locale()

   This member function is protected: it is called by the constructors of
   the derived stream classes std::basic_istream and std::basic_ostream
   once the associated stream buffer is known. Until this function is
   called, every member function (including the destructor) of the
   default-constructed std::basic_ios invokes undefined behavior. Note
   that basic_ios is a virtual base class, and therefore its constructor
   is not called by the constructors of those directly derived classes,
   which is why two-stage initialization is necessary.

Parameters

   sb - stream buffer to associate to
