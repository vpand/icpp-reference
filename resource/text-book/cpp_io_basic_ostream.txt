   Defined in header <ostream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
   > class basic_ostream : virtual public std::basic_ios<CharT, Traits>

   The class template basic_ostream provides support for high level output
   operations on character streams. The supported operations include
   formatted output (e.g. integer values) and unformatted output (e.g. raw
   characters and character arrays). This functionality is implemented in
   terms of the interface provided by the basic_streambuf class, accessed
   through the basic_ios base class. In typical implementations,
   basic_ostream has no non-inherited data members.

   Several typedefs for common character types are provided:
   Defined in header <ostream>
   Type          Definition

Global objects

   Six global basic_ostream objects are provided by the standard library:
