   template< class Fn >
   explicit scope_success( Fn&& fn ) noexcept(/*see below*/);

   scope_success( scope_success&& other ) noexcept(/*see below*/);

   (3) (library fundamentals TS v3)

   Creates a scope_success from a function, a function object or another
   scope_success.
   1) Initializes the exit function with a function or function object,
   and initializes the counter of uncaught exceptions as if with
   std::uncaught_exceptions(). The constructed scope_success is active.
   If Fn is not an lvalue reference type and
   std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<EF, Fn> is true, the stored EF is
   initialized with std::forward<Fn>(fn); otherwise it is initialized with
   fn.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::is_same_v<std::remove_cvref_t<Fn>, scope_success> is false and
   std::is_constructible_v<EF, Fn> is true.
   The program is ill-formed if function call expression fn() is
   ill-formed.
   The behavior is undefined if calling fn() results in undefined
   behavior, even if fn has not been called.
   2) Move constructor. Initializes the stored EF with the one in other,
   and initializes the counter of uncaught exceptions with the one in
   other. The constructed scope_success is active if and only if other is
   active before the construction.
   If std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true, initializes stored
   EF (denoted by exitfun) with std::forward<EF>(other.exitfun), otherwise
   initializes it with other.exitfun.
   After successful move construction, other.release() is called and other
   becomes inactive.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true or
   std::is_copy_constructible_v<EF> is true.
   The behavior is undefined if
     * std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is true and EF does not
       meet the requirements of MoveConstructible, or
     * std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> is false and EF does not
       meet the requirements of CopyConstructible.

   3) scope_success is not CopyConstructible.

Parameters

   fn    - function or function object used for initializing the stored EF
   other - scope_success to move from

Exceptions

   Any exception thrown during the initialization of the stored EF.
   1)
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<EF, Fn> ||
            std::is_nothrow_constructible_v<EF, Fn&>)

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<EF> ||
            std::is_nothrow_copy_constructible_v<EF>)
