   This is a list of reserved keywords in C++. Since they are used by the
   language, these keywords are not available for re-definition or
   overloading. As an exception, they are not considered reserved in
   attributes (excluding attribute argument lists).(since C++11)

     * (3) -- meaning changed or new meaning added in C++20.
     * (4) -- new meaning added in C++23.

   Note that and, bitor, or, xor, compl, bitand, and_eq, or_eq, xor_eq,
   not, and not_eq (along with the digraphs <%, %>, <:, :>, %:, and %:%:)
   provide an alternative way to represent standard tokens. These keywords
   are also considered reserved in attributes (excluding attribute
   argument lists), but some implementations handle them the same as the
   others.(since C++11)

   In addition to keywords, there are identifiers with special meaning,
   which may be used as names of objects or functions, but have special
   meaning in certain contexts.

   final (C++11)
   override (C++11)
   transaction_safe (TM TS)
   transaction_safe_dynamic (TM TS)
   import (C++20)
   module (C++20)

   Also, all identifiers that contain a double underscore __ in any
   position and each identifier that begins with an underscore followed by
   an uppercase letter is always reserved and all identifiers that begin
   with an underscore are reserved for use as names in the global
   namespace. See identifiers for more details.

   The namespace std is used to place names of the standard C++ library.
   See Extending namespace std for the rules about adding names to it.

   The name posix is reserved for a future top-level namespace. The
   behavior is undefined if a program declares or defines anything in that
   namespace.
   (since C++11)

   The following tokens are recognized by the preprocessor when in context
   of a preprocessor directive:

   if
   elif
   else
   endif

   ifdef
   ifndef
   elifdef (C++23)
   elifndef (C++23)

   define
   undef
   include
   line

   error
   warning (C++23)
   pragma

   defined
   __has_include (C++17)
   __has_cpp_attribute (C++20)

   export (C++20)
   import (C++20)
   module (C++20)

   The following tokens are recognized by the preprocessor outside the
   context of a preprocessor directive:

   _Pragma (C++11)
