   Deduction guides

   Defined in header <experimental/scope>
   template< class R, class D >
   unique_resource( R, D ) -> unique_resource<R, D>;
                                         (library fundamentals TS v3)

   One deduction guide is provided for std::experimental::unique_resource
   to permit deduction from given resource handle and deleter.

   The arguments (after array-to-pointer and function-to-pointer decay, if
   any) are copied or moved into the constructed unique_resource.
