   Defined in header <locale>
   static locale global( const locale& loc );

   Replaces the global C++ locale with loc, which means all future calls
   to the std::locale default constructor will now return a copy of loc.
   If loc has a name, also replaces the C locale as if by
   std::setlocale(LC_ALL, loc.name().c_str());. This function is the only
   way to modify the global C++ locale, which is otherwise equivalent to
   std::locale::classic() at program startup.

Parameters

   loc - the new global C++ locale

Return value

   The previous value of the global C++ locale.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 8 C++98 it was unspecified whether other library functions (such
   as std::setlocale) can modify the global C++ locale specified (no other
   library functions allowed)
