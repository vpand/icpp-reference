   std::experimental::observer_ptr is a non-owning pointer, or observer.
   The observer stores a pointer to a second object, known as the watched
   object. An observer_ptr may also have no watched object.

   An observer is not responsible in any way for the watched object; there
   is no inherent relationship between an observer and the object it
   watches.

   It is intended as a near drop-in replacement for raw pointer types,
   with the advantage that, as a vocabulary type, it indicates its
   intended use without need for detailed analysis by code readers.

   Specializations of observer_ptr satisfy the requirements of
   CopyConstructible and CopyAssignable.
   Type requirements
   -
   W shall not be a reference type, but may be an incomplete type.

Member types

   Member type  Definition
   element_type W, the type of the object watched by this observer_ptr

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new observer_ptr
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   (implicitly declared)
   destructs an observer_ptr
   (public member function)
   operator=
   (implicitly declared)
   implicitly declared copy and move assignment operators that assign the
   stored pointer
   (public member function)

Modifiers

   release
   returns a pointer to the watched object and stops watching the object
   (public member function)
   reset
   replaces the watched object
   (public member function)
   swap
   swaps the watched objects
   (public member function)

Observers

   get
   returns a pointer to the watched object
   (public member function)
   operator bool
   checks if there is an associated watched object
   (public member function)
   operator*operator->
   dereferences pointer to the watched object
   (public member function)

Conversions

   operator element_type*
   explicit conversion function to the stored pointer
   (public member function)

Non-member functions

   make_observer
   creates an observer_ptr that watches an object
   (function template)
   operator==operator!=operator<operator<=operator>operator>=
   compares to another observer_ptr or with nullptr
   (function template)
   std::experimental::swap(std::experimental::observer_ptr)
   specializes the swap algorithm
   (function template)

Helper classes

   std::hash<std::experimental::observer_ptr>
   hash support for observer_ptr
   (class template specialization)
