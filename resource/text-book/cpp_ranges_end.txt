   Returns a sentinel indicating the end of a range.

   If the argument is an lvalue or
   ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is true, then a call
   to ranges::end is expression-equivalent to:
    1. t + std::extent_v<T> if t has an array type of known bound.
          + If std::remove_all_extents_t<std::remove_reference_t<T>> is
            incomplete, then the call to ranges::end is ill-formed, no
            diagnostic required.
    2. Otherwise, decay-copy(t.end())(until C++23)auto(t.end())(since
       C++23), if that expression is valid, and its type models
       std::sentinel_for<ranges::iterator_t<T>>.
    3. Otherwise, decay-copy(end(t))(until C++23)auto(end(t))(since
       C++23), if T is a class or enumeration type, that expression is
       valid and its converted type models
       std::sentinel_for<ranges::iterator_t<T>>, where the meaning of end
       is established as if by performing argument-dependent lookup only.

   In all other cases, a call to ranges::end is ill-formed, which can
   result in substitution failure when the call to ranges::end appears in
   the immediate context of a template instantiation.

Customization point objects

   The name ranges::end denotes a customization point object, which is a
   const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For
   exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted
   as __end_fn.

   All instances of __end_fn are equal. The effects of invoking different
   instances of type __end_fn on the same arguments are equivalent,
   regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance is an lvalue
   or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a volatile-qualified
   instance is not required to be invocable). Thus, ranges::end can be
   copied freely and its copies can be used interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the
   requirements for arguments to ranges::end above, __end_fn models
     * std::invocable<__end_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<const __end_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<__end_fn&, Args...>, and
     * std::invocable<const __end_fn&, Args...>.

   Otherwise, no function call operator of __end_fn participates in
   overload resolution.

Notes

   If the argument is an rvalue (i.e. T is an object type) and
   ranges::enable_borrowed_range<std::remove_cv_t<T>> is false, or if it
   is of an array type of unknown bound, the call to ranges::end is
   ill-formed, which also results in substitution failure.

   If ranges::end(std::forward<T>(t)) is valid, then
   decltype(ranges::end(std::forward<T>(t))) and
   decltype(ranges::begin(std::forward<T>(t))) model std::sentinel_for in
   all cases, while T models std::ranges::range.

   The C++20 standard requires that if the underlying end function call
   returns a prvalue, the return value is move-constructed from the
   materialized temporary object. All implementations directly return the
   prvalue instead. The requirement is corrected by the post-C++20
   proposal P0849R8 to match the implementations.

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> vec{3, 1, 4};
    if (std::ranges::find(vec, 5) != std::ranges::end(vec))
        std::cout << "found a 5 in vector vec!\n";

    int arr[]{5, 10, 15};
    if (std::ranges::find(arr, 5) != std::ranges::end(arr))
        std::cout << "found a 5 in array arr!\n";
}

   Output:
found a 5 in array arr!
