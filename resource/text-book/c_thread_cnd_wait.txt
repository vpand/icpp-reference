   Defined in header <threads.h>
   int cnd_wait( cnd_t* cond, mtx_t* mutex );
                                             (since C11)

   Atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mutex and blocks on the
   condition variable pointed to by cond until the thread is signalled by
   cnd_signal or cnd_broadcast, or until a spurious wake-up occurs. The
   mutex is locked again before the function returns.

   The behavior is undefined if the mutex is not already locked by the
   calling thread.

Parameters

   cond  - pointer to the condition variable to block on
   mutex - pointer to the mutex to unlock for the duration of the block

Return value

   thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
