   Defined in header <cstring>
   const char* strchr( const char* str, int ch );
         char* strchr(       char* str, int ch );

   Finds the first occurrence of the character static_cast<char>(ch) in
   the byte string pointed to by str.

   The terminating null character is considered to be a part of the string
   and can be found if searching for '\0'.

Parameters

   str - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be analyzed
   ch  - character to search for

Return value

   Pointer to the found character in str, or a null pointer if no such
   character is found.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const char* str = "Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.";
    char target = 'T';
    const char* result = str;

    while ((result = std::strchr(result, target)) != nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "Found '" << target
                  << "' starting at '" << result << "'\n";

        // Increment result, otherwise we'll find target at the same location
        ++result;
    }
}

   Output:
Found 'T' starting at 'Try not. Do, or do not. There is no try.'
Found 'T' starting at 'There is no try.'
