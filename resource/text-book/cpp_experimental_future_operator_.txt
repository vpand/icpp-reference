   std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( std::experimental::future<T>&&
   other ) noexcept;
   (1)
   std::experimental::future<T>& operator=( const
   std::experimental::future<T>& other ) = delete;
   (2)

   Assigns the contents of another future object.
   1) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to
   *this. After the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid()
   will yield the same value as other.valid() before the assignment.
   2) std::experimental::future is not CopyAssignable.

Parameters

   other - a std::experimental::future that will transfer state to *this

Return value

   *this
