   private:
   ios_base( const ios_base& );
                 (until C++11)
   public:
   ios_base( const ios_base& ) = delete;

   (2)
   1) The copy constructor is private(until C++11)deleted(since C++11):
   streams are not copyable.
   2) The default constructor is protected: only derived classes may
   construct std::ios_base. The internal state is undefined after the
   construction. The derived class must call std::basic_ios::init() to
   complete initialization before first use or before destructor;
   otherwise the behavior is undefined.

Notes

   The same applies to the constructors of the next class in the I/O
   hierarchy, std::basic_ios. Further-derived classes (std::istream and
   std::ostream) are always constructed with a concrete stream buffer
   object and call std::basic_ios::init(), possibly more than once, to
   complete initialization of their virtual base.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 50 C++98 the copy constructor was not specified specified as
   private
   LWG 220 C++98 the behavior of destroying a std::ios_base
   object before calling its init() was not clear the behavior is
   undefined in this case
   LWG 1249 C++98 initialization did not need to be completed before first
   use also needs to be completed
