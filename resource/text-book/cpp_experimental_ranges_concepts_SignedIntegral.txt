   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >
   concept bool SignedIntegral = Integral<T> && std::is_signed<T>::value;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept SignedIntegral<T> is satisfied if and only if T is an
   integral type and std::is_signed<T>::value is true.

   There need not be any subsumption relationship between
   SignedIntegral<T> and std::is_signed<T>::value.

Notes

   SignedIntegral<T> may be satisfied by a type that is not a signed
   integer type, for example, char (on a system where char is signed).
