   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fclose( std::FILE* stream );

   Closes the given file stream. Any unwritten buffered data are flushed
   to the OS. Any unread buffered data are discarded.

   Whether or not the operation succeeds, the stream is no longer
   associated with a file, and the buffer allocated by std::setbuf or
   std::setvbuf, if any, is also disassociated and deallocated if
   automatic allocation was used.

   The behavior is undefined if the value of the pointer stream is used
   after fclose returns.

Parameters

   stream - the file stream to close

Return value

   0 on success, EOF otherwise.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

int main()
{
    int is_ok = EXIT_FAILURE;
    FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
    if (!fp)
    {
        std::perror("File opening failed");
        return is_ok;
    }

    int c; // Note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
    while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) // Standard C I/O file reading loop
        std::putchar(c);

    if (std::ferror(fp))
        std::puts("I/O error when reading");
    else if (std::feof(fp))
    {
        std::puts("End of file reached successfully");
        is_ok = EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    std::fclose(fp);
    return is_ok;
}

   Output:
End of file reached successfully
