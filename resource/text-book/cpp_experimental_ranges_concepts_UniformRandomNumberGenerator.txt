   UniformRandomNumberGenerator

   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/random>
   template< class G >

   concept bool UniformRandomNumberGenerator =
       Invocable<G&> &&
       UnsignedIntegral<std::result_of_t<G&()>> &&
       requires {
           { G::min() } -> Same<std::result_of_t<G&()>>&&;
           { G::max() } -> Same<std::result_of_t<G&()>>&&;
       };
                                                 (ranges TS)

   The concept UniformRandomNumberGenerator<G> specifies that G is the
   type of a uniform random number generator, that is, objects of type G
   is a function object returning unsigned integer values such that each
   value in the range of possible results has (ideally) equal probability
   of being returned.

   UniformRandomNumberGenerator<G> is satisfied only if, given any object
   g of type G:
     * G::min() and G::max() are prvalue constant expressions;
     * G::min() < G::max()
     * g() is in the range [G::min(), G::max()]
     * g() has amortized constant complexity.
