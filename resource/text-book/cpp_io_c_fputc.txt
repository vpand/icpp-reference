   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fputc( int ch, std::FILE* stream );
   int putc( int ch, std::FILE* stream );

   Writes a character ch to the given output stream stream.

   Internally, the character is converted to unsigned char just before
   being written.

   In C, putc() may be implemented as a macro, which is disallowed in C++.
   Therefore, calls to std::fputc() and std::putc() always have the same
   effect.

Parameters

   ch     - character to be written
   stream - output stream

Return value

   On success, returns the written character.

   On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see
   std::ferror()) on stream.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>

int main()
{
    for (char c = 'a'; c != 'z'; c++)
        std::putc(c, stdout);

    // putchar's return value is not equal to the argument
    int r = 0x102A;
    std::printf("\nr = 0x%x\n", r);

    r = std::putchar(r);
    std::printf("\nr = 0x%x\n", r);
}

   Possible output:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxy
r = 0x102A
*
r = 0x2A
