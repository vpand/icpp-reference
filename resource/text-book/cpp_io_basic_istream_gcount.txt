   operator>>(std::basic_istream)

   std::streamsize gcount() const;

   Returns the number of characters extracted by the last unformatted
   input operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize
   if the number is not representable.

   The following member functions of basic_istream change the value of
   subsequent gcount() calls:
     * move constructor
     * swap()
     * get()
     * getline()
     * ignore()
     * read()
     * readsome()
     * operator>>(basic_streambuf*)

   The following functions set gcount() to zero:
     * constructor
     * putback()
     * unget()
     * peek()

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The number of characters extracted by the last unformatted input
   operation, or the maximum representable value of std::streamsize if the
   number is not representable.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    char x[20];
    std::istringstream stream("Hello World");

    stream.read(x, sizeof x);
    std::cout << "Characters extracted: " << stream.gcount();
}

   Output:
Characters extracted: 11

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 3464 C++98 the return value was unspecified when the result
   overflows returns the maximum value
