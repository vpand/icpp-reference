   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/iterator>
   template< class I, class T >

   concept bool OutputIterator =
       Iterator<I> && Writable<I, T> &&
       requires(I i, T&& t) {
           *i++ = std::forward<T>(t); // not required to be equality
   preserving
       };
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The OutputIterator concept is a refinement of Iterator, adding the
   requirement that it can be used to write values of values of type and
   value category encoded by T (via Writable). EqualityComparable is not
   required.

   Let E be an expression such that decltype((E)) is T, and i be a
   dereferenceable object of type I. OutputIterator<I, T> is satisfied
   only if *i++ = E; has effects equivalent to *i = E; ++i;.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

Notes

   Unlike the output iterator requirements in the C++ standard,
   OutputIterator in the Ranges TS does not require that the iterator
   category tag be defined.

   Algorithms on output iterators should be single pass.
