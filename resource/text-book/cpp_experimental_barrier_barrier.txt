   explicit barrier( std::ptrdiff_t num_threads );
   (1)                                            (concurrency TS)
   barrier( const barrier & ) = delete;
   (2)                                            (concurrency TS)
   1) Constructs a barrier for num_threads participating threads. The set
   of participating threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at
   the synchronization point.
   2) Copy constructor is deleted; barrier is not copyable.

Parameters

   num_threads - the number of participating threads for the barrier; must
   be non-negative

Notes

   If num_threads is zero, the set of participating threads is empty, and
   barrier can only be destroyed.
