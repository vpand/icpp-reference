   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class domain_error;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It may be used by
   the implementation to report domain errors, that is, situations where
   the inputs are outside of the domain on which an operation is defined.

   The standard library components do not throw this exception
   (mathematical functions report domain errors as specified in
   math_errhandling). Third-party libraries, however, use this. For
   example, boost.math throws std::domain_error if
   boost::math::policies::throw_on_error is enabled (the default setting).

   Inheritance diagram

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new domain_error object with the given message
   (public member function)
   operator=
   replaces the domain_error object
   (public member function)

std::domain_error::domain_error

   domain_error( const std::string& what_arg );
   (1)
   domain_error( const char* what_arg );
   (2)
   domain_error( const domain_error& other );
   (3)                                         (noexcept since C++11)
   1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string.
   After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.
   2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string.
   After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.
   3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type
   std::domain_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No
   exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string
   other    - another exception object to copy

Exceptions

   1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

Notes

   Because copying std::domain_error is not permitted to throw exceptions,
   this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated
   reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor
   taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

   Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can
   only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order
   to construct a std::string object.

   After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception
   class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be
   implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by
   what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

std::domain_error::operator=

   domain_error& operator=( const domain_error& other );
                                                        (noexcept since C++11)

   Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have
   dynamic type std::domain_error then std::strcmp(what(), other.what())
   == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy
   assignment operator.

Parameters

   other - another exception object to assign with

Return value

   *this

Notes

   After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception
   class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can
   be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by
   what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

Defect reports

   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 254 C++98 the constructor accepting const char* was missing added
   LWG 471 C++98 the explanatory strings of std::domain_error's
   copies were implementation-defined they are the same as that of the
   original std::domain_error object
