   Opens and associates the file with name filename with the file stream.

   Calls clear() on success. Calls setstate(failbit) on failure.
   1,2) Effectively calls rdbuf()->open(filename, mode | ios_base::in)
   (see std::basic_filebuf::open for the details on the effects of that
   call). Overload (2) is only provided if
   std::filesystem::path::value_type is not char.(since C++17)
   3,4) Effectively calls (1,2) as if by open(filename.c_str(), mode).

Parameters

   filename - the name of the file to be opened
   mode - specifies stream open mode. It is a BitmaskType, the following
   constants are defined:
   Constant          Explanation
   app               seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary            open in binary mode
   in                open for reading
   out               open for writing
   trunc             discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate               seek to the end of stream immediately after open
   noreplace (C++23) open in exclusive mode

Return value

   (none)

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 22 C++98 it was unclear how error state changes upon a successful
   open the error state is unchanged
   LWG 409 C++98 the error state was unchanged upon a successful open it
   is cleared^[1]
    1. ^| The resolution of LWG issue #22 is overriden.
