   Defined in header <experimental/scope>
   template< class EF >
   class scope_exit;
                                         (library fundamentals TS v3)

   The class template scope_exit is a general-purpose scope guard intended
   to call its exit function when a scope is exited.

   scope_exit is not CopyConstructible, CopyAssignable or MoveAssignable,
   however, it may be MoveConstructible if EF meets some requirements,
   which permits wrapping a scope_exit into another object.

   A scope_exit may be either active, i.e. calls its exit function on
   destruction, or inactive, i.e. does nothing on destruction. A
   scope_exit is active after constructed from an exit function.

   A scope_exit can become inactive by calling release() on it either
   manually or automatically (by the move constructor). An inactive
   scope_exit may also be obtained by initializing with another inactive
   scope_exit. Once a scope_exit is inactive, it cannot become active
   again.

   A scope_exit effectively holds an EF and a bool flag indicating if it
   is active.

Template parameters

   EF - type of stored exit function
   Type requirements
   -
   EF shall be either:
     * a Destructible FunctionObject type,
     * an lvalue reference to FunctionObject,
     * an lvalue reference to function.

   -
   Calling an lvalue of std::remove_reference_t<EF> with no argument shall
   be well-formed.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new scope_exit
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   calls the exit function when the scope is exited if the scope_exit is
   active, then destroys the scope_exit
   (public member function)
   operator=
   [deleted]
   scope_exit is not assignable
   (public member function)

Modifiers

   release
   makes the scope_exit inactive
   (public member function)

Deduction guides

Notes

   Constructing a scope_exit of dynamic storage duration might lead to
   unexpected behavior.

   If the EF stored in a scope_exit object refers to a local variable of
   the function where it is defined, e.g., as a lambda capturing the
   variable by reference, and that variable is used as a return operand in
   that function, that variable might have already been returned when the
   scope_exit's destructor executes, calling the exit function. This can
   lead to surprising behavior.
