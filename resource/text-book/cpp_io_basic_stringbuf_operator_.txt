   std::basic_stringbuf& operator=( std::basic_stringbuf&& rhs );
   (1) (since C++11)
   std::basic_stringbuf& operator=( const std::basic_stringbuf& rhs ) =
   delete;
   (2)
   1) Move assignment operator: Moves the contents of rhs into *this.
   After the move, *this has the associated string, the open mode, the
   locale, and all other state formerly held by rhs. The six pointers of
   std::basic_streambuf in *this are guaranteed to be different from the
   corresponding pointers in the moved-from rhs unless null.
   2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; basic_stringbuf is not
   CopyAssignable.

Parameters

   rhs - another basic_stringbuf that will be moved from

Return value

   *this

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::istringstream one("one");
    std::ostringstream two("two");

    std::cout << "Before move, one = \"" << one.str() << '"'
              << " two = \"" << two.str() << "\"\n";

    *one.rdbuf() = std::move(*two.rdbuf());

    std::cout << "After move, one = \"" << one.str() << '"'
              << " two = \"" << two.str() << "\"\n";
}

   Output:
Before move, one = "one" two = "two"
After move, one = "two" two = ""
