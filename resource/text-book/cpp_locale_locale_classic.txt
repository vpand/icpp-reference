   Defined in header <locale>
   static const locale& classic();

   Obtains a reference to the C++ locale that implements the classic "C"
   locale semantics. This locale, unlike the global locale, cannot be
   altered.

Parameters

   none

Return value

   Returns a reference to the "C" locale.

Notes

   Some of the standard-required facets, such as the UTF-8/UTF-32
   conversion facet std::codecvt<char32_t, char, std::mbstate_t>, have no
   equivalents in the "C" locale, but they are nevertheless present in the
   locale returned by std::locale::classic(), as in any other locale
   constructed in a C++ program.
