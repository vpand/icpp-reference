   protected:
   void swap( basic_ios& other ) noexcept;
             (since C++11)

   Exchanges the states of *this and other, except for the associated
   rdbuf objects. rdbuf() and other.rdbuf() returns the same values as
   before the call.

   This swap function is protected: it is called by the swap member
   functions of the derived stream classes such as std::basic_ofstream or
   std::basic_istringstream, which know how to correctly swap the
   associated streambuffers.

Parameters

   other - the basic_ios object to exchange the state with

Return value

   (none)

   (C++11)
