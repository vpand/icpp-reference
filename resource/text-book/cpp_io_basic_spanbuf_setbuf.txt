   n ) override;
             (since C++23)

   Makes the basic_spanbuf perform I/O on the buffer [s, s + n).
   Equivalently calls this->span(std::span<CharT>(s, n)) and then returns
   this.

   std::ios_base::out && std::ios_base::ate s s + n s + n

   This function is protected virtual, it may only be called through
   pubsetbuf() or from member functions of a user-defined class derived
   from std::basic_spanbuf.

Parameters

   s - pointer to the first CharT in the user-provided buffer
   n - the number of CharT elements in the user-provided buffer

Return value

   this

Notes

   The deprecated stream buffer std::strstreambuf or the boost.IOStreams
   device boost::basic_array can also implement I/O buffering over a
   user-provided char array.
