   std::fpos
   Member functions
   fpos::state

   State state() const;
   (1)
   void state( State st );
   (2)

   Manages the file position state.
   1) Returns the value of the file position state.
   2) Replaces the file position state with the value of st.

   For the specializations of std::fpos that are used in the standard
   library, State is always std::mbstate_t.

Parameters

   st - new value for the state

Return value

   1) The current value of the fpos state.
   2) (none)

Example

   Run this code
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::istringstream s("test");
    std::mbstate_t st = s.tellg().state();

    if (std::mbsinit(&st))
        std::cout << "The stream is in the initial shift state\n";
}

   Output:
The stream is in the initial shift state

   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 441 C++98 overload (1) was not declared const (it is const in the
   synopsis) added const
