   Defined in header <threads.h>
   int thrd_join( thrd_t thr, int *res );
                                         (since C11)

   Blocks the current thread until the thread identified by thr finishes
   execution.

   If res is not a null pointer, the result code of the thread is put to
   the location pointed to by res.

   The termination of the thread synchronizes-with the completion of this
   function.

   The behavior is undefined if the thread was previously detached or
   joined by another thread.

Parameters

   thr - identifier of the thread to join
   res - location to put the result code to

Return value

   thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
