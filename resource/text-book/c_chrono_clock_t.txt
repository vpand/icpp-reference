   Defined in header <time.h>
   typedef /* unspecified */ clock_t;

   Arithmetic(until C11)Real(since C11) type capable of representing the
   processor time used by a process. It has implementation-defined range
   and precision.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <math.h>

volatile double sink;
int main (void)
{
  clock_t start = clock();

  for(size_t i=0; i<3141592; ++i)
      sink+=sin(i);

  clock_t end = clock();
  double cpu_time_used = ((double) (end - start)) / CLOCKS_PER_SEC;

  printf("for loop took %f seconds to execute \n", cpu_time_used);
}

   Possible output:
for loop took 0.271828 seconds to execute
