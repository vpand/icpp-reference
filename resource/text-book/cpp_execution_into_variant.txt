   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto into_variant(

       execution::sender auto snd
   );
                                       (since C++26)

Parameters

   snd - input sender which can send multiple sets of values depending on
   runtime conditions.

Return value

   Returns a sender that sends a variant of tuples of all the possible
   sets of types sent by the input sender. The helper function turns them
   into a single variant value.
