   Defined in header <ios>
   typedef /*implementation-defined*/ streamsize;

   The type std::streamsize is an implementation-defined signed integral
   type used to represent the number of characters transferred in an I/O
   operation or the size of an I/O buffer. It is used as a signed
   counterpart of std::size_t, similar to the POSIX type ssize_t.

   Except in the constructors of std::strstreambuf, negative values of
   std::streamsize are never used.
