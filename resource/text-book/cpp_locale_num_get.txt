   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class InputIt = std::istreambuf_iterator<CharT>
   > class num_get;

   Class std::num_get encapsulates the rules for parsing string
   representations of numeric values. Specifically, types bool, unsigned
   short, unsigned int, long, unsigned long, long long, unsigned long
   long(since C++11), float, double, long double, and void* are supported.
   The standard formatting input operators (such as cin >> n;) use the
   std::num_get facet of the I/O stream's locale to parse the text
   representations of the numbers.

   Inheritance diagram

   If a std::num_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by
   the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its get() and
   do_get() are not guaranteed as specified.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale
   object):
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::num_get<char>    creates narrow string parsing of numbers
   std::num_get<wchar_t> creates wide string parsing of numbers

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every
   specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:
     * CharT is one of
          + char,
          + wchar_t, and
          + any other implementation-defined character container type that
            meets the requirements for a character on which any of the
            iostream components can be instantiated; and
     * InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   char_type   CharT

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new num_get facet
   (public member function)
   get
   invokes do_get
   (public member function)

Member objects

   static std::locale::id id
   id of the locale
   (public member object)

Protected member functions

   (destructor)
   destructs a num_get facet
   (protected member function)
   do_get
   [virtual]
   parses a number from an input stream
   (virtual protected member function)

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string de_double = "1.234.567,89";
    std::string us_double = "1,234,567.89";

    // parse using streams
    std::istringstream de_in(de_double);
    de_in.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
    double f1;
    de_in >> f1;

    std::istringstream us_in(de_double);
    us_in.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    double f2;
    us_in >> f2;

    std::cout << "Parsing " << de_double << " as double gives " << std::fixed
              << f1 << " in de_DE locale and " << f2 << " in en_US\n";

    // use the facet directly
    std::istringstream s3(us_double);
    s3.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));

    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::num_get<char>>(s3.getloc());
    std::istreambuf_iterator<char> beg(s3), end;
    double f3;
    std::ios::iostate err;
    f.get(beg, end, s3, err, f3);

    std::cout << "parsing " << us_double
              << " as double using raw en_US facet gives " << f3 << '\n';
}

   Output:
Parsing 1.234.567,89 as double gives 1234567.890000 in de_DE locale and 1.234000
 in en_US
parsing 1,234,567.89 as double using raw en_US facet gives 1234567.890000

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 427 C++98 num_get was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
   meets the requirements for a character on which
   any of the iostream components can be instantiated only guarantees to
   accept char,
   wchar_t and other implementation-
   defined character types
   LWG 2392 C++98 only character type CharT could be
   guaranteed to be accepted by num_get can guarantee to accept
   implementation-
   defined character container types
