   Defined in header <fstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
   > class basic_fstream : public std::basic_iostream<CharT, Traits>

   The class template basic_fstream implements high-level input/output
   operations on file based streams. It interfaces a file-based
   streambuffer (std::basic_filebuf) with the high-level interface of
   (std::basic_iostream).

   A typical implementation of std::basic_fstream holds only one
   non-derived data member: an instance of std::basic_filebuf<CharT,
   Traits>.

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string filename{"test.bin"};
    std::fstream s{filename, s.binary | s.trunc | s.in | s.out};

    if (!s.is_open())
        std::cout << "failed to open " << filename << '\n';
    else
    {
        // write
        double d{3.14};
        s.write(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&d), sizeof d); // binary output
        s << 123 << "abc";                              // text output

        // for fstream, this moves the file position pointer (both put and get)
        s.seekp(0);

        // read
        d = 2.71828;
        s.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&d), sizeof d); // binary input
        int n;
        std::string str;
        if (s >> n >> str)                             // text input
            std::cout << "read back from file: " << d << ' ' << n << ' ' << str
<< '\n';
    }
}

   Output:
read back from file: 3.14 123 abc
