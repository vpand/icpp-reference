   Defined in header <csignal>
   typedef /* unspecified */ sig_atomic_t;

   An integer type which can be accessed as an atomic entity even in the
   presence of asynchronous interrupts made by signals.

Notes

   Until C++11, which introduced std::atomic and std::atomic_signal_fence,
   about the only thing a strictly conforming program could do in a signal
   handler was to assign a value to a volatile static std::sig_atomic_t
   variable and promptly return.
