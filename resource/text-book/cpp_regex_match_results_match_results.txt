   1) Default constructor. Constructs a match result with no established
   result state (ready() != true).
   2) Constructs a match result with no established result state (ready()
   != true) using a copy of a as the allocator.
   3) Copy constructor. Constructs a match result with a copy of rhs.
   4) Constructs a match result with a copy of rhs, and uses a copy of a
   as the allocator.
   5) Move constructor. Constructs a match result with the contents of rhs
   using move semantics. rhs is in valid, but unspecified state after the
   call.
   6) Constructs a match result with the contents of rhs using move
   semantics, and uses a copy of a as the allocator. rhs is in valid, but
   unspecified state after the call.

Parameters

   a - allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container
   rhs - another match_results to use as source to initialize the
   match_results with

Exceptions

   1-4) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
   6) Throws nothing if a == rhs.get_allocator() is true.
