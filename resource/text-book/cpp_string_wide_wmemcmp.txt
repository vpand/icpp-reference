   Defined in header <cwchar>
   int wmemcmp( const wchar_t* lhs, const wchar_t* rhs, std::size_t count
   );

   Compares the first count wide characters of the wide character arrays
   pointed to by lhs and rhs. The comparison is done lexicographically.

   The sign of the result is the sign of the difference between the values
   of the first pair of wide characters that differ in the arrays being
   compared.

   If count is zero, the function does nothing.

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - pointers to the wide character arrays to compare
   count    - number of wide characters to examine

Return value

   Negative value if the value of the first differing wide character in
   lhs is less than the value of the corresponding wide character in rhs:
   lhs precedes rhs in lexicographical order.

   0 if all count wide characters of lhs and rhs are equal.

   Positive value if the value of the first differing wide character in
   lhs is greater than the value of the corresponding wide character in
   rhs: rhs precedes lhs in lexicographical order.

Notes

   This function is not locale-sensitive and pays no attention to the
   values of the wchar_t objects it examines: nulls as well as invalid
   wide characters are compared too.

Example

   Run this code
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <string>

void demo(const wchar_t* lhs, const wchar_t* rhs, std::size_t sz)
{
    std::wcout << std::wstring(lhs, sz);
    int rc = std::wmemcmp(lhs, rhs, sz);
    if (rc == 0)
        std::wcout << " compares equal to ";
    else if (rc < 0)
        std::wcout << " precedes ";
    else if (rc > 0)
        std::wcout << " follows ";
    std::wcout << std::wstring(rhs, sz) << " in lexicographical order\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));

    wchar_t a1[] = {L'a',L'b',L'g'};
    constexpr std::size_t sz = sizeof a1 / sizeof *a1;
    wchar_t a2[sz] = {L'a',L'b',L'd'};

    demo(a1, a2, sz);
    demo(a2, a1, sz);
    demo(a1, a1, sz);
}

   Possible output:
abg precedes abd in lexicographical order
abd follows abg in lexicographical order
abg compares equal to abg in lexicographical order
