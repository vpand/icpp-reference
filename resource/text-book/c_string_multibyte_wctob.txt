   Defined in header <wchar.h>
   int wctob( wint_t c );
                              (since C95)

   Narrows a wide character c if its multibyte character equivalent in the
   initial shift state is a single byte.

   This is typically possible for the characters from the ASCII character
   set, since most multibyte encodings (such as UTF-8) use single bytes to
   encode those characters.

Parameters

   c - wide character to narrow

Return value

   EOF if c does not represent a multibyte character with length 1 in
   initial shift state.

   otherwise, the single-byte representation of c as unsigned char
   converted to int

Example

   Run this code
#include <locale.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <assert.h>

void try_narrowing(wchar_t c)
{
    int cn = wctob(c);
    if(cn != EOF)
        printf("%#x narrowed to %#x\n", c, cn);
    else
        printf("%#x could not be narrowed\n", c);
}

int main(void)
{
    char* utf_locale_present = setlocale(LC_ALL, "th_TH.utf8");
    assert(utf_locale_present);
    puts("In Thai UTF-8 locale:");
    try_narrowing(L'a');
    try_narrowing(L'');

    char* tis_locale_present = setlocale(LC_ALL, "th_TH.tis620");
    assert(tis_locale_present);
    puts("In Thai TIS-620 locale:");
    try_narrowing(L'a');
    try_narrowing(L'');
}

   Possible output:
In Thai UTF-8 locale:
0x61 narrowed to 0x61
0xe5b could not be narrowed
In Thai TIS-620 locale:
0x61 narrowed to 0x61
0xe5b narrowed to 0xfb
