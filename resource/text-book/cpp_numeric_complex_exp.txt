   Defined in header <complex>
   template< class T >
   std::complex<T> exp( const std::complex<T>& z );

   Compute base-e exponential of z, that is e (Euler's number, 2.7182818)
   raised to the z power.

Parameters

   z - complex value

Return value

   If no errors occur, e raised to the power of z, \(\small e^z\)ez
   , is returned.

Error handling and special values

   Errors are reported consistent with math_errhandling.

   If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic,
     * std::exp(std::conj(z)) == std::conj(std::exp(z))
     * If z is (±0,+0), the result is (1,+0)
     * If z is (x,+infty) (for any finite x), the result is (NaN,NaN) and
       FE_INVALID is raised.
     * If z is (x,NaN) (for any finite x), the result is (NaN,NaN) and
       FE_INVALID may be raised.
     * If z is (+infty,+0), the result is (+infty,+0)
     * If z is (-infty,y) (for any finite y), the result is +0cis(y)
     * If z is (+infty,y) (for any finite nonzero y), the result is
       +inftycis(y)
     * If z is (-infty,+infty), the result is (±0,±0) (signs are
       unspecified)
     * If z is (+infty,+infty), the result is (±infty,NaN) and FE_INVALID
       is raised (the sign of the real part is unspecified)
     * If z is (-infty,NaN), the result is (±0,±0) (signs are unspecified)
     * If z is (+infty,NaN), the result is (±infty,NaN) (the sign of the
       real part is unspecified)
     * If z is (NaN,+0), the result is (NaN,+0)
     * If z is (NaN,y) (for any nonzero y), the result is (NaN,NaN) and
       FE_INVALID may be raised
     * If z is (NaN,NaN), the result is (NaN,NaN)

   where \(\small{\rm cis}(y)\)cis(y) is \(\small \cos(y)+{\rm
   i}\sin(y)\)cos(y) + i sin(y).

Notes

   The complex exponential function \(\small e^z\)ez
   for \(\small z = x + {\rm i}y\)z = x+iy equals \(\small e^x {\rm
   cis}(y)\)ex
   cis(y), or, \(\small e^x (\cos(y)+{\rm i}\sin(y))\)ex
   (cos(y) + i sin(y)).

   The exponential function is an entire function in the complex plane and
   has no branch cuts.

   The following have equivalent results when the real part is 0:
     * std::exp(std::complex<float>(0, theta))
     * std::complex<float>(cosf(theta), sinf(theta))
     * std::polar(1.f, theta)

   In this case exp can be about 4.5x slower. One of the other forms
   should be used instead of calling exp with an argument whose real part
   is literal 0. There is no benefit in trying to avoid exp with a runtime
   check of z.real() == 0 though.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cmath>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
   const double pi = std::acos(-1.0);
   const std::complex<double> i(0.0, 1.0);

   std::cout << std::fixed << " exp(i * pi) = " << std::exp(i * pi) << '\n';
}

   Output:
exp(i * pi) = (-1.000000,0.000000)
