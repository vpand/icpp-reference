   Defined in header <wchar.h>
   wint_t btowc( int c );
                              (since C95)

   Widens a single-byte character c (reinterpreted as unsigned char) to
   its wide character equivalent.

   Most multibyte character encodings use single-byte codes to represent
   the characters from the ASCII character set. This function may be used
   to convert such characters to wchar_t.

Parameters

   c - single-byte character to widen

Return value

   WEOF if c is EOF

   wide character representation of c if (unsigned char)c is a valid
   single-byte character in the initial shift state, WEOF otherwise.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>
#include <locale.h>
#include <assert.h>

void try_widen(unsigned char c)
{
    wint_t w = btowc(c);
    if(w != WEOF)
        printf("The single-byte character %#x widens to %#x\n", c, w);
    else
        printf("The single-byte character %#x failed to widen\n", c);
}

int main(void)
{
    char *loc = setlocale(LC_ALL, "lt_LT.iso88594");
    assert(loc);
    printf("In Lithuanian ISO-8859-4 locale:\n");
    try_widen('A');
    try_widen('\xdf'); // German letter ß (U+00df) in ISO-8859-4
    try_widen('\xf9'); // Lithuanian letter u (U+0173) in ISO-8859-4

    setlocale(LC_ALL, "lt_LT.utf8");
    printf("In Lithuanian UTF-8 locale:\n");
    try_widen('A');
    try_widen('\xdf');
    try_widen('\xf9');
}

   Possible output:
In Lithuanian ISO-8859-4 locale:
The single-byte character 0x41 widens to 0x41
The single-byte character 0xdf widens to 0xdf
The single-byte character 0xf9 widens to 0x173
In Lithuanian UTF-8 locale:
The single-byte character 0x41 widens to 0x41
The single-byte character 0xdf failed to widen
The single-byte character 0xf9 failed to widen
