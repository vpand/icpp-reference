   std::streamsize sgetn( char_type* s, std::streamsize count );
   (1)
   protected:
   virtual std::streamsize xsgetn( char_type* s, std::streamsize count );
   (2)
   1) Calls xsgetn(s, count) of the most derived class.
   2) Reads count characters from the input sequence and stores them into
   a character array pointed to by s. The characters are read as if by
   repeated calls to sbumpc(). That is, if less than count characters are
   immediately available, the function calls uflow() to provide more until
   Traits::eof() is returned.
   Classes derived from std::basic_streambuf are permitted to provide more
   efficient implementations of this function.

Parameters

   s     - pointer to the beginning of a char_type array
   count - maximum number of characters to read.

Return value

   The number of characters successfully read. If it is less than count
   the input sequence has reached the end.

Notes

   The rule about "more efficient implementations" permits bulk I/O
   without intermediate buffering: that's how std::ifstream::read simply
   passes the pointer to the POSIX read() system call in some
   implementations of iostreams
