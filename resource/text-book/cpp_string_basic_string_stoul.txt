   Interprets an unsigned integer value in the string str.

   Let ptr be an internal (to the conversion functions) pointer of type
   char* (1,3) or wchar_t* (2,4), accordingly.
   1) Calls std::strtoul(str.c_str(), &ptr, base).
   2) Calls std::wcstoul(str.c_str(), &ptr, base).
   3) Calls std::strtoull(str.c_str(), &ptr, base).
   4) Calls std::wcstoull(str.c_str(), &ptr, base).

   Discards any whitespace characters (as identified by calling
   std::isspace) until the first non-whitespace character is found, then
   takes as many characters as possible to form a valid base-n (where
   n=base) unsigned integer number representation and converts them to an
   integer value. The valid unsigned integer value consists of the
   following parts:
     * (optional) plus or minus sign
     * (optional) prefix (0) indicating octal base (applies only when the
       base is 8 or 0)
     * (optional) prefix (0x or 0X) indicating hexadecimal base (applies
       only when the base is 16 or 0)
     * a sequence of digits

   The set of valid values for base is {0,2,3,...,36}. The set of valid
   digits for base-2 integers is {0,1}, for base-3 integers is {0,1,2},
   and so on. For bases larger than 10, valid digits include alphabetic
   characters, starting from Aa for base-11 integer, to Zz for base-36
   integer. The case of the characters is ignored.

   Additional numeric formats may be accepted by the currently installed C
   locale.

   If the value of base is 0, the numeric base is auto-detected: if the
   prefix is 0, the base is octal, if the prefix is 0x or 0X, the base is
   hexadecimal, otherwise the base is decimal.

   If the minus sign was part of the input sequence, the numeric value
   calculated from the sequence of digits is negated as if by unary minus
   in the result type, which applies unsigned integer wraparound rules.

   If pos is not a null pointer, then ptr will receive the address of the
   first unconverted character in str.c_str(), and the index of that
   character will be calculated and stored in *pos, giving the number of
   characters that were processed by the conversion.

Parameters

   str  - the string to convert
   pos  - address of an integer to store the number of characters processed
   base - the number base

Return value

   The string converted to the specified unsigned integer type.

Exceptions

     * std::invalid_argument if no conversion could be performed.
     * std::out_of_range if the converted value would fall out of the
       range of the result type or if the underlying function
       (std::strtoul or std::strtoull) sets errno to ERANGE.
