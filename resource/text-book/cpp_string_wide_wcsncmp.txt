   Defined in header <cwchar>
   int wcsncmp( const wchar_t* lhs, const wchar_t* rhs, std::size_t count
   );

   Compares at most count wide characters of two null-terminated wide
   strings. The comparison is done lexicographically.

   The sign of the result is the sign of the difference between the values
   of the first pair of wide characters that differ in the strings being
   compared.

   The behavior is undefined if lhs or rhs are not pointers to
   null-terminated strings.

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - pointers to the null-terminated wide strings to compare
   count    - maximum number of characters to compare

Return value

   Negative value if lhs appears before rhs in lexicographical order.

   Zero if lhs and rhs compare equal.

   Positive value if lhs appears after rhs in lexicographical order.

Example

   Run this code
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

void demo(const wchar_t* lhs, const wchar_t* rhs, int sz)
{
    int rc = std::wcsncmp(lhs, rhs, sz);
    if (rc == 0)
        std::wcout << "First " << sz << " characters of ["
                   << lhs << "] equal [" << rhs << "]\n";
    else if (rc < 0)
        std::wcout << "First " << sz << " characters of ["
                   << lhs << "] precede [" << rhs << "]\n";
    else if (rc > 0)
        std::wcout << "First " << sz << " characters of ["
                   << lhs << "] follow [" << rhs << "]\n";
}

int main()
{
    const wchar_t str1[] = L"¸";
    const wchar_t str2[] = L" ­¤";

    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    demo(str1, str2, 5);
    demo(str2, str1, 8);
    demo(str1, str2, 2);
}

   Output:
First 5 characters of [¸] precede [ ­¤]
First 8 characters of [ ­¤] follow [¸]
First 2 characters of [¸] equal [ ­¤]
