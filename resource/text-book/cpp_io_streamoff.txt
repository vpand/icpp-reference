   Defined in header <ios>
   typedef /*implementation-defined*/ streamoff;

   The type std::streamoff is an implementation-defined signed
   integral(since C++11) type of sufficient size to represent the maximum
   possible file size supported by the operating system. Typically, this
   is an alias for long long.(since C++11)

   It is used to represent offsets from stream positions (values of type
   std::fpos). A std::streamoff value constructed from -1 is also used to
   represent error conditions by some of the I/O library functions.

Relationship with std::fpos

     * the difference between two std::fpos objects is a value of type
       std::streamoff

     * a value of type std::streamoff may be added or subtracted from
       std::fpos yielding a different std::fpos.

     * a value of type std::fpos is implicitly convertible to
       std::streamoff (the conversion result is the offset from the
       beginning of the file).

     * a value of type std::fpos is constructible from a value of type
       std::streamoff
