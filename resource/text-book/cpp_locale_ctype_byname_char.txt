   Defined in header <locale>
   template<>
   class ctype_byname : public std::ctype<char>;

   This specialization of std::ctype_byname encapsulates character
   classification features for type char. Like its base class
   std::ctype<char> and unlike general-purpose std::ctype_byname, table
   lookup is used to classify characters

   (constructor)
   constructs a new ctype_byname<char> facet

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

int main()
{
    char c = '\xde'; // capital letter thorn

    std::locale loc("C");

    std::cout << "isupper('Þ', C locale) returned "
               << std::boolalpha << std::isupper(c, loc) << '\n';

    loc = std::locale(loc, new std::ctype_byname<char>("en_US.utf8"));

    std::cout << "isupper('Þ', C locale with Unicode ctype<char>) returned "
              << std::boolalpha << std::isupper(c, loc) << '\n';

    loc = std::locale(loc, new std::ctype_byname<char>("is_IS.iso88591"));

    std::cout << "isupper('Þ', C locale with Islandic ctype<char>) returned "
              << std::boolalpha << std::isupper(c, loc) << '\n';
}

   Output:
isupper('Þ', C locale) returned false
isupper('Þ', C locale with Unicode ctype<char>) returned false
isupper('Þ', C locale with Islandic ctype<char>) returned true
