   (since C++26)

   Searches the range [first, last) for the first sequence of count
   identical elements, each equal to the given value.
   1) Elements are compared using operator==.
   3) Elements are compared using the given binary predicate p.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to examine
   count - the length of the sequence to search for
   value - the value of the elements to search for
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   p - binary predicate which returns true if the elements should be
   treated as equal.

   The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the
   following:

    bool pred(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

   While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must
   not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all
   values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value
   category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a
   move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The type Type1 must be such that an object of type ForwardIt can be
   dereferenced and then implicitly converted to Type1. The type Type2
   must be such that an object of type T can be implicitly converted to
   Type2.
   Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   BinaryPred must meet the requirements of BinaryPredicate.
   -
   Size must be convertible to an integral type.

Return value

   If count is positive, returns an iterator to the beginning of the first
   sequence found in the range [first, last). Each iterator it in the
   sequence should satisfy the following condition:
   1,2) *it == value is true.
   3,4) p(*it, value) != false is true.

   If no such sequence is found, last is returned.

   If count is zero or negative, first is returned.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):
   1,2) At most \(\scriptsize N\)N comparisons using operator==.
   3,4) At most \(\scriptsize N\)N applications of the predicate p.

Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <vector>

template<class Container, class Size, class T>
constexpr bool consecutive_values(const Container& c, Size count, const T& v)
{
    return std::search_n(std::begin(c), std::end(c), count, v) != std::end(c);
}

int main()
{
    constexpr char sequence[] = ".0_0.000.0_0.";

    static_assert(consecutive_values(sequence, 3, '0'));

    for (int n : {4, 3, 2})
        std::cout << std::boolalpha
                  << "Has " << n << " consecutive zeros: "
                  << consecutive_values(sequence, n, '0') << '\n';

    std::vector<std::complex<double>> nums{{4, 2}, {4, 2}, {1, 3}};
    #ifdef __cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type
        auto it = std::search_n(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend(), 2, {4, 2});
    #else
        auto it = std::search_n(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend(), 2, std::complex<doub
le>{4, 2});
    #endif
    assert(it == nums.begin());
}

   Output:
Has 4 consecutive zeros: false
Has 3 consecutive zeros: true
Has 2 consecutive zeros: true

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 283 C++98 T was required to be EqualityComparable, but
   the value type of InputIt is not always T removed the requirement
   LWG 426 C++98 the complexity upper limit was N·count,
   it is negative if count is negative the upper limit is 0
   if count is non-positive
   LWG 714 C++98 if count > 0, the complexity upper limit was N·count, but
   in
   the worst case the number of comparisons/operations is always N changed
   the upper
   limit to N in this case
   LWG 2150 C++98 the condition of "sequence occurence" was incorrect
   corrected
