   class Init;

   This class is used to ensure that the default C++ streams (std::cin,
   std::cout, etc.) are properly initialized and destructed. The class
   tracks how many instances of it are created and initializes the C++
   streams when the first instance is constructed as well as flushes the
   output streams when the last instance is destructed.

   The header <iostream> behaves as if it defines (directly or indirectly)
   an instance of std::ios_base::Init with static storage duration: this
   makes it safe to access the standard I/O streams in the constructors
   and destructors of static objects with ordered initialization (as long
   as <iostream> is included in the translation unit before these objects
   were defined).

   Each C++ library module in a hosted implementation behaves as if it
   contains an interface unit that defines an unexported
   std::ios_base::Init variable with ordered initialization.

   As a result, the definition of that variable is appearance-ordered
   before any declaration following the point of importation of a C++
   library module. Whether such a definition exists is unobservable by a
   program that does not reference any of the standard iostream objects.
   (since C++23)

Member functions

   (constructor)
   initializes the default C++ streams if they have not been created yet
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   flushes the default C++ streams if *this is the last instance to be
   destroyed
   (public member function)

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 1123 C++98 the behaviors of the constructor and the destructor
   depend on an exposition-only static data member init_cnt removed the
   dependency
