   Reads data from a variety of sources, interprets it according to format
   and stores the results into given locations.
   1) reads the data from stdin
   2) reads the data from file stream stream
   3) reads the data from null-terminated character string buffer.
   Reaching the end of the string is equivalent to reaching the
   end-of-file condition for fscanf
   4-6) Same as (1-3), except that %c, %s, and %[ conversion specifiers
   each expect two arguments (the usual pointer and a value of type
   rsize_t indicating the size of the receiving array, which may be 1 when
   reading with a %c into a single char) and except that the following
   errors are detected at runtime and call the currently installed
   constraint handler function:

          + any of the arguments of pointer type is a null pointer
          + format, stream, or buffer is a null pointer
          + the number of characters that would be written by %c, %s, or
            %[, plus the terminating null character, would exceed the
            second (rsize_t) argument provided for each of those
            conversion specifiers
          + optionally, any other detectable error, such as unknown
            conversion specifier

          As with all bounds-checked functions, scanf_s , fscanf_s, and
          sscanf_s are only guaranteed to be available if
          __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the implementation and if the
          user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1
          before including <stdio.h>.

Parameters

   stream - input file stream to read from
   buffer - pointer to a null-terminated character string to read from
   format - pointer to a null-terminated character string specifying how
   to read the input
   ... - receiving arguments.

   The format string consists of
     * non-whitespace multibyte characters except %: each such character
       in the format string consumes exactly one identical character from
       the input stream, or causes the function to fail if the next
       character on the stream does not compare equal.
     * whitespace characters: any single whitespace character in the
       format string consumes all available consecutive whitespace
       characters from the input (determined as if by calling isspace in a
       loop). Note that there is no difference between "\n", " ", "\t\t",
       or other whitespace in the format string.
     * conversion specifications. Each conversion specification has the
       following format:

          + introductory % character.

          + (optional) assignment-suppressing character *. If this option
            is present, the function does not assign the result of the
            conversion to any receiving argument.

          + (optional) integer number (greater than zero) that specifies
            maximum field width, that is, the maximum number of characters
            that the function is allowed to consume when doing the
            conversion specified by the current conversion specification.
            Note that %s and %[ may lead to buffer overflow if the width
            is not provided.

          + (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the
            receiving argument, that is, the actual destination type. This
            affects the conversion accuracy and overflow rules. The
            default destination type is different for each conversion type
            (see table below).

          + conversion format specifier.

   The following format specifiers are available:
   Conversion
   specifier Explanation Argument type
   Length modifier ->
   hh

   (C99)
   h (none) l ll

   (C99)
   j

   (C99)
   z

   (C99)
   t

   (C99)
   L
   % Matches literal %. N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
   c

          Matches a character or a sequence of characters.

   If a width specifier is used, matches exactly width characters (the
   argument must be a pointer to an array with sufficient room). Unlike %s
   and %[, does not append the null character to the array.
   N/A N/A
   char*
   wchar_t*
   N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
   s

          Matches a sequence of non-whitespace characters (a string).

   If width specifier is used, matches up to width or until the first
   whitespace character, whichever appears first. Always stores a null
   character in addition to the characters matched (so the argument array
   must have room for at least width+1 characters)
   [set]

          Matches a non-empty sequence of character from set of
          characters.

   If the first character of the set is ^, then all characters not in the
   set are matched. If the set begins with ] or ^] then the ] character is
   also included into the set. It is implementation-defined whether the
   character - in the non-initial position in the scanset may be
   indicating a range, as in [0-9]. If width specifier is used, matches
   only up to width. Always stores a null character in addition to the
   characters matched (so the argument array must have room for at least
   width+1 characters)
   d

          Matches a decimal integer.

   The format of the number is the same as expected by strtol with the
   value 10 for the base argument
   signed char* or unsigned char*
   signed short* or unsigned short*
   signed int* or unsigned int*
   signed long* or unsigned long*
   signed long long* or unsigned long long*
   intmax_t* or uintmax_t*
   size_t*
   ptrdiff_t*
   N/A
   i

          Matches an integer.

   The format of the number is the same as expected by strtol with the
   value 0 for the base argument (base is determined by the first
   characters parsed)
   u

          Matches an unsigned decimal integer.

   The format of the number is the same as expected by strtoul with the
   value 10 for the base argument.
   o

          Matches an unsigned octal integer.

   The format of the number is the same as expected by strtoul with the
   value 8 for the base argument
   x, X

          Matches an unsigned hexadecimal integer.

   The format of the number is the same as expected by strtoul with the
   value 16 for the base argument
   n

          Returns the number of characters read so far.

   No input is consumed. Does not increment the assignment count. If the
   specifier has assignment-suppressing operator defined, the behavior is
   undefined
   a, A(C99)
   e, E
   f, F(C99)
   g, G

          Matches a floating-point number.

   The format of the number is the same as expected by strtof
   N/A N/A
   float*
   double*
   N/A N/A N/A N/A
   long double*
   p

          Matches implementation defined character sequence defining a
          pointer.

   printf family of functions should produce the same sequence using %p
   format specifier
   N/A N/A
   void**
   N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A

   For every conversion specifier other than n, the longest sequence of
   input characters which does not exceed any specified field width and
   which either is exactly what the conversion specifier expects or is a
   prefix of a sequence it would expect, is what's consumed from the
   stream. The first character, if any, after this consumed sequence
   remains unread. If the consumed sequence has length zero or if the
   consumed sequence cannot be converted as specified above, the matching
   failure occurs unless end-of-file, an encoding error, or a read error
   prevented input from the stream, in which case it is an input failure.

   All conversion specifiers other than [, c, and n consume and discard
   all leading whitespace characters (determined as if by calling isspace)
   before attempting to parse the input. These consumed characters do not
   count towards the specified maximum field width.

   The conversion specifiers lc, ls, and l[ perform multibyte-to-wide
   character conversion as if by calling mbrtowc with an mbstate_t object
   initialized to zero before the first character is converted.

   The conversion specifiers s and [ always store the null terminator in
   addition to the matched characters. The size of the destination array
   must be at least one greater than the specified field width. The use of
   %s or %[, without specifying the destination array size, is as unsafe
   as gets.

   The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width integer types
   (int8_t, etc) are defined in the header <inttypes.h> (although SCNdMAX,
   SCNuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju, etc).

   There is a sequence point after the action of each conversion
   specifier; this permits storing multiple fields in the same "sink"
   variable.

   When parsing an incomplete floating-point value that ends in the
   exponent with no digits, such as parsing "100er" with the conversion
   specifier %f, the sequence "100e" (the longest prefix of a possibly
   valid floating-point number) is consumed, resulting in a matching error
   (the consumed sequence cannot be converted to a floating-point number),
   with "r" remaining. Some existing implementations do not follow this
   rule and roll back to consume only "100", leaving "er", e.g. glibc bug
   1765.

   If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

Return value

   1-3) Number of receiving arguments successfully assigned (which may be
   zero in case a matching failure occurred before the first receiving
   argument was assigned), or EOF if input failure occurs before the first
   receiving argument was assigned.
   4-6) Same as (1-3), except that EOF is also returned if there is a
   runtime constraint violation.

Complexity

   Not guaranteed. Notably, some implementations of sscanf are O(N), where
   N = strlen(buffer) [1].

Notes

   Because most conversion specifiers first consume all consecutive
   whitespace, code such as
scanf("%d", &a);
scanf("%d", &b);

   will read two integers that are entered on different lines (second %d
   will consume the newline left over by the first) or on the same line,
   separated by spaces or tabs (second %d will consume the spaces or
   tabs).
   The conversion specifiers that do not consume leading whitespace, such
   as %c, can be made to do so by using a whitespace character in the
   format string:
scanf("%d", &a);
scanf(" %c", &c); // consume all consecutive whitespace after %d, then read a ch
ar

Example

   Run this code
#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <locale.h>

int main(void)
{
    int i, j;
    float x, y;
    char str1[10], str2[4];
    wchar_t warr[2];
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");

    char input[] = "25 54.32E-1 Thompson 56789 0123 56ߴ";
    /* parse as follows:
       %d: an integer
       %f: a floating-point value
       %9s: a string of at most 9 non-whitespace characters
       %2d: two-digit integer (digits 5 and 6)
       %f:  a floating-point value (digits 7, 8, 9)
       %*d: an integer which isn't stored anywhere
       ' ': all consecutive whitespace
       %3[0-9]: a string of at most 3 decimal digits (digits 5 and 6)
       %2lc: two wide characters, using multibyte to wide conversion  */
    int ret = sscanf(input, "%d%f%9s%2d%f%*d %3[0-9]%2lc",
                     &i, &x, str1, &j, &y, str2, warr);

    printf("Converted %d fields:\n"
           "i = %d\n"
           "x = %f\n"
           "str1 = %s\n"
           "j = %d\n"
           "y = %f\n"
           "str2 = %s\n"
           "warr[0] = U+%x\n"
           "warr[1] = U+%x\n",
           ret, i, x, str1, j, y, str2, warr[0], warr[1]);

#ifdef __STDC_LIB_EXT1__
    int n = sscanf_s(input, "%d%f%s", &i, &x, str1, (rsize_t)sizeof str1);
    // writes 25 to i, 5.432 to x, the 9 bytes "Thompson\0" to str1, and 3 to n.
#endif
}

   Possible output:
Converted 7 fields:
i = 25
x = 5.432000
str1 = Thompson
j = 56
y = 789.000000
str2 = 56
warr[0] = U+df
warr[1] = U+6c34
