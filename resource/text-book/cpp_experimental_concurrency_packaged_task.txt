   This page is about the modified version of std::packaged_task provided
   by the concurrency TS supporting the std::future improvements made by
   that TS. For the version of packaged_task with type-erased allocator
   support provided by the Library Fundamentals TSes, see
   std::experimental::fundamentals_v2::packaged_task.

   std::experimental::concurrency_v1::packaged_task is a modified version
   of std::packaged_task provided by the concurrency TS that works with
   std::experimental::future.

   The only change from std::packaged_task is that the get_future() member
   function returns a std::experimental::future<R>.
