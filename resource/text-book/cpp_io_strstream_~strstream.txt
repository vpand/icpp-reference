   virtual ~strstream();
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   Destroys a std::strstream object, which also destroys the member
   std::strstreambuf, which may call the deallocation function if the
   underlying buffer was dynamically-allocated and not frozen.

Parameters

   (none)

Notes

   If str() was called on a dynamic strstream and freeze(false) was not
   called after that, this destructor leaks memory.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    {
        std::ostrstream s; // dynamic buffer
        s << 1.23 << std::ends;
        std::cout << s.str() << '\n';
        s.freeze(false);
    } // destructor called, buffer deallocated

    {
        std::ostrstream s;
        s << 1.23 << std::ends;
        std::cout << s.str() << '\n';
//      buf.freeze(false);
    } // destructor called, memory leaked

    {
        std::istrstream s("1.23"); // constant buffer
        double d;
        s >> d;
        std::cout << d << '\n';
    } // destructor called, nothing to deallocate
}

   Output:
1.23
1.23
1.23
