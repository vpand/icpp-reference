   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class F, class... Args >

   concept bool Invocable =
       requires(F&& f, Args&&... args) {
           ranges::invoke(std::forward<F>(f),
   std::forward<Args>(args)...);
               /* not required to be equality preserving */
       };
                                                   (ranges TS)
   template< class F, class... Args >
   concept bool RegularInvocable = Invocable<F, Args...>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The Invocable concept specifies that a callable type F can be called
   with a set of argument types Args... using the function template
   ranges::invoke.

   The RegularInvocable concept adds to the Invocable concept by requiring
   the invoke expression to be equality preserving and not modify either
   the function object or the arguments.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.

Notes

   The distinction between Invocable and RegularInvocable is purely
   semantic.

   A random number generator may satisfy Invocable but cannot satisfy
   RegularInvocable (comical ones excluded).
