   Types
   mbstate_t
   (C95)

   Defined in header <wchar.h>
   size_t mbrlen( const char *s, size_t n, mbstate_t *ps );
   (since C95)
   (until C99)
   size_t mbrlen( const char *restrict s, size_t n, mbstate_t *restrict ps
   );
   (since C99)

   Determines the size, in bytes, of the representation of a multibyte
   character.

   This function is equivalent to the call mbrtowc(NULL, s, n,
   ps?ps:&internal) for some hidden object internal of type mbstate_t,
   except that the expression ps is evaluated only once.

Parameters

   s  - pointer to an element of a multibyte character string
   n  - limit on the number of bytes in s that can be examined
   ps - pointer to the variable holding the conversion state

Return value

   The first of the following that applies:
     * 0 if the next n or fewer bytes complete the null character or if s
       is a null pointer. Both cases reset the conversion state.
     * the number of bytes [1...n] that complete a valid multibyte
       character
     * (size_t)-2 if the next n bytes are part of a possibly valid
       multibyte character, which is still incomplete after examining all
       n bytes
     * (size_t)-1 if encoding error occurs. The value of errno is EILSEQ;
       the conversion state is unspecified.

Example

   Run this code
#include <locale.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <wchar.h>

int main(void)
{
    // allow mbrlen() to work with UTF-8 multibyte encoding
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    // UTF-8 narrow multibyte encoding
    const char* str = u8"´";
    size_t sz = strlen(str);

    mbstate_t mb;
    memset(&mb, 0, sizeof mb);
    int len1 = mbrlen(str, 1, &mb);
    if(len1 == -2)
        printf("The first 1 byte of %s is an incomplete multibyte char"
               " (mbrlen returns -2)\n", str);

    int len2 = mbrlen(str+1, sz-1, &mb);
    printf("The remaining %zu  bytes of %s hold %d bytes of the multibyte"
           " character\n", sz-1, str, len2);

    printf("Attempting to call mbrlen() in the middle of %s while in initial"
           " shift state returns %zd\n", str, mbrlen(str+1, sz-1, &mb));
}

   Output:
The first 1 byte of ´ is an incomplete multibyte char (mbrlen returns -2)
The remaining 2  bytes of ´ hold 2 bytes of the multibyte character
Attempting to call mbrlen() in the middle of ´ while in initial shift state retu
rns -1
