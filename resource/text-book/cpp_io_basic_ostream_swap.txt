   protected:
   void swap( basic_ostream& rhs );
             (since C++11)

   Calls basic_ios::swap(rhs) to swap all data members of the base class,
   except for rdbuf(), between *this and rhs. This swap function is
   protected: it is called by the swap functions of the swappable output
   stream classes std::basic_ofstream and std::basic_ostringstream, which
   know how to correctly swap the associated streambuffers.

Parameters

   rhs - a basic_ostream of the same type to swap with

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <utility>

int main()
{
    std::ostringstream s1("hello");
    std::ostringstream s2("bye");

    s1.swap(s2); // OK, ostringstream has a public swap()
    std::swap(s1, s2); // OK, calls s1.swap(s2)

//  std::cout.swap(s2); // ERROR: swap is a protected member

    std::cout << s1.str() << '\n';
}

   Output:
hello
