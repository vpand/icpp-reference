   void store( weak_ptr<T> desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the current value with desired. Memory is affected
   according to the value of order.

   order must be one of std::memory_order_relaxed,
   std::memory_order_release or std::memory_order_seq_cst. Otherwise the
   behavior is undefined.

Parameters

   desired - the weak_ptr to store into the atomic variable
   order   - memory order constraints to enforce

Return value

   (none)

Remarks

   All changes to the atomic_weak_ptr object itself, and all associated
   use_count increments, are guaranteed to be performed atomically.
   Associated use_count decrements take place after the atomic operation,
   but are not required to be part of it. Any associated destruction or
   deallocation operations take place after the atomic operation and are
   not part of it.
