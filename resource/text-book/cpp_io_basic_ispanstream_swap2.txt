   (C++23)

   Defined in header <spanstream>
   template< class CharT, class Traits >

   void swap( std::basic_ispanstream<CharT, Traits>& lhs,
              std::basic_ispanstream<CharT, Traits>& rhs );
                                        (since C++23)

   Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::basic_ispanstream. Exchanges
   the state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls lhs.swap(rhs).

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - streams whose state to swap

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
