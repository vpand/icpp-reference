   protected:
   virtual int_type uflow()

   Behaves like the underflow(), except that if underflow() succeeds (does
   not return Traits::eof()), then advances the next pointer for the get
   area. In other words, consumes one of the characters obtained by
   underflow().

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The value of the character that was read and consumed in case of
   success, or Traits::eof() in case of failure.
