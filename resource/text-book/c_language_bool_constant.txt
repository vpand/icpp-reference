Syntax

   true  (1) (since C23)
   false (2) (since C23)

Explanation

   Keywords true and false represent predefined constants. They are
   non-lvalues of type bool.

Notes

   See integral conversions for implicit conversions from bool to other
   types and boolean conversions for the implicit conversions from other
   types to bool.

   Until C23, true and false were implemented as macros provided in
   <stdbool.h>. An implementation may also define bool, true, and false as
   predefined macros in C23 for compatibility.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("%d\n%d\n", true, false);
}

   Output:
1
0
