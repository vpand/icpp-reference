   concept bool BidirectionalIterator =
       ForwardIterator<I> &&
       DerivedFrom<ranges::iterator_category_t<I>,
   ranges::bidirectional_iterator_tag> &&
       requires(I i) {
           { --i } -> Same<I>&;
           { i-- } -> Same<I>&&;

                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept BidirectionalIterator<I> refines ForwardIterator by adding
   the ability to move an iterator backward.

   A bidirectional iterator r is said to be decrementable if and only if
   there exists some s such that ++s == r. All decrementable iterators r
   shall be in the domain of the expressions --r and r--.

   Let a and b be decrementable objects of type I.
   BidirectionalIterator<I> is satisfied only if:
     * Pre-decrement yields an lvalue that refers to the operand:
       std::addressof(--a) == std::addressof(a).
     * Post-decrement yields the previous value of the operand: if bool(a
       == b), then bool(a-- == b).
     * Post-decrement and pre-decrement perform the same modification on
       its operand: If bool(a == b), then after evaluating both a-- and
       --b, bool(a == b) still holds.
     * Increment and decrement are inverses of each other:

          + If a is incrementable and bool(a == b), then bool(--(++a) ==
            b).
          + If bool(a == b), then bool(++(--a) == b).

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.
