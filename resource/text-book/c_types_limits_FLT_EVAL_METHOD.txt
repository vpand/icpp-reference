   Defined in header <float.h>
   #define FLT_EVAL_METHOD /* implementation defined */
                                                       (since C99)

   Specifies range and precision of floating-point values obtained from
   floating-point constants and from all operations (operators, implicit
   conversions of operands) except assignment, cast, and library function
   call.
   Value Explanation
   negative values except -1 implementation-defined behavior
   -1 the default precision is not known
   0 all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of
   the type used. Additionally, float_t and double_t are equivalent to
   float and double respectively
   1 all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of
   double. Additionally, both float_t and double_t are equivalent to
   double
   2 all operations and constants evaluate in the range and precision of
   long double. Additionally, both float_t and double_t are equivalent to
   long double

Notes

   Regardless of the value of FLT_EVAL_METHOD, any floating-point
   expression may be contracted, that is, calculated as if all
   intermediate results have infinite range and precision (unless #pragma
   STDC FP_CONTRACT is off)

   Cast and assignment strip away any extraneous range and precision: this
   models the action of storing a value from an extended-precision FPU
   register into a standard-sized memory location.
