   Eager execution

   Defined in header <execution>
   auto sync_wait( execution::sender auto sender )

       requires (/*always-sends-some-values*/(sender))
           -> std::optional<std::tuple</*value-sent-by*/(sender)>>;
                                                  (since C++26)

Parameters

   sender - sender upon which the completion of sync_wait is blocked

Return value

   Returns an optional tuple of values that were sent by the provided
   sender on its completion of work.

Notes

   The sender returned by sync_wait similarly to ensure_started, except
   that it blocks the current std::thread or thread of main until the work
   is completed.

See also

   ensure_started
   Eagerly starts a sender, returning a sender that will deliver the
   results to a receiver to which it is connected and started, if any.
   When the result sender is not connected to a receiver, or if the
   resulting operation state is not started, the results are ignored. If
   such a sender is destroyed before the underlying operation completes,
   the operation continues running detached.
