   Defined in header <iostream>
   extern std::ostream clog;
   (1)
   extern std::wostream wclog;
   (2)

   The global objects std::clog and std::wclog control output to a stream
   buffer of implementation-defined type (derived from std::streambuf),
   associated with the standard C output stream stderr, but, unlike
   std::cerr/std::wcerr, these streams are not automatically flushed and
   cout is not automatically tie()'d with these streams.

   These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the
   first time an object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are
   available for use in the constructors and destructors of static objects
   with ordered initialization (as long as <iostream> is included before
   the object is defined).

   Unless std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) has been issued, it is
   safe to concurrently access these objects from multiple threads for
   both formatted and unformatted output.

Notes

   The 'c' in the name refers to "character" (stroustrup.com FAQ); clog
   means "character log" and wclog means "wide character log".

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>

struct Foo
{
    int n;
    Foo()
    {
        std::clog << "static constructor\n";
    }
    ~Foo()
    {
        std::clog << "static destructor\n";
    }
};

Foo f; // static object

int main()
{
    std::clog << "main function\n";
}

   Output:
static constructor
main function
static destructor
