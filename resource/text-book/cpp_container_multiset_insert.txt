   Inserts element(s) into the container. The order of the remaining
   equivalent elements is preserved.
   1,2) Inserts value. If the container has elements with equivalent key,
   inserts at the upper bound of that range.
   3,4) Inserts value in the position as close as possible to the position
   just prior to pos.
   5) Inserts elements from range [first, last).
   6) Inserts elements from initializer list ilist.
   7) If nh is an empty node handle, does nothing. Otherwise, inserts the
   element owned by nh into the container and returns an iterator pointing
   at the inserted element. If a range containing elements with keys
   equivalent to nh.key() exists in the container, the element is inserted
   at the end of that range. The behavior is undefined if nh is not empty
   and get_allocator() != nh.get_allocator().
   8) If nh is an empty node handle, does nothing and returns the end
   iterator. Otherwise, inserts the element owned by nh into the
   container, and returns the iterator pointing to the element with key
   equivalent to nh.key(). The element is inserted as close as possible to
   the position just prior to pos. The behavior is undefined if nh is not
   empty and get_allocator() != nh.get_allocator().

   No iterators or references are invalidated. If the insertion is
   successful, pointers and references to the element obtained while it is
   held in the node handle are invalidated, and pointers and references
   obtained to that element before it was extracted become valid.(since
   C++17)

Parameters

   pos - iterator to the position before which the new element will be
   inserted
   value - element value to insert
   first, last - range of elements to insert
   ilist - initializer list to insert the values from
   nh - a compatible node handle
   Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

Return value

   1-4) An iterator to the inserted element.
   5,6) (none)
   7,8) End iterator if nh was empty, iterator pointing to the inserted
   element otherwise.

Exceptions

   1-4,7,8) If an exception is thrown by any operation, the insertion has
   no effect.
   5,6) No exception safety guarantee.

Complexity

   1,2,7) O(log(size()))
   3,4,8) Amortized constant if the insertion happens in the position just
   before pos, O(log(size())) otherwise.
   5,6) O(N·log(size() + N)), where N is the number of elements to insert.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 233 C++98 pos was just a hint, it could be totally ignored the
   insertion is required to
   be as close as possible to the
   position just prior to pos
   LWG 264 C++98 the complexity of overload (5) was required to be linear
   if
   the range [first, last) is sorted according to Compare removed the
   linear requirement
   in this special case
   LWG 371 C++98 the order of equivalent elements was not guaranteed to be
   preserved required to be preserved
