   protected:
   virtual int_type overflow ( int_type c = Traits::eof() );

   Writes some data from the put area to the associated character sequence
   (to the file).

   Behaves like the base class std::basic_streambuf::overflow, except that
   to write the data, first uses std::codecvt::out of the imbued locale to
   convert the characters into external (possibly multibyte)
   representation, stored in a temporary buffer (allocated as large as
   necessary), then uses file I/O to copy all fully-converted bytes into
   the file.

   If std::codecvt::always_noconv is true, the call to std::codecvt::out
   may be skipped.

   If the conversion fails with std::codecvt_base::error, returns
   Traits::eof() without attempting any output.

   If the associated file is not open (is_open() == false), returns
   Traits::eof() before doing anything.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   Traits::not_eof(c) to indicate success or Traits::eof() to indicate
   failure.
