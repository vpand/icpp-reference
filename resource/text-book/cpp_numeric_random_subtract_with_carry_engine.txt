   Defined in header <random>
   template<

       class UIntType,
       std::size_t w, std::size_t s, std::size_t r
   > class subtract_with_carry_engine;
                             (since C++11)

   Is a random number engine that uses subtract with carry algorithm.

Template parameters

   UIntType - The result type generated by the generator. The effect is
   undefined if this is not one of unsigned short, unsigned int, unsigned
   long, or unsigned long long.
   w - the word size, in bits, of the state sequence
   s - the short lag
   r - the long lag

   If w is not in [1, std::numeric_limits<UIntType>::digits], or s is not
   in [1, r), the program is ill-formed.

Generator properties

   The size of the states of subtract_with_carry_engine is \(O(r)\)O(r),
   each of them consists of two parts:
     * A sequence X of r integer values, where each value is in [0, 2w
       ).
     * An integer c (known as the carry¿), whose value is either 0 or 1.

   Given that \(X_j\)X
   j stands for the \(j\mod r\)j mod rth value (starting from 0) of X, the
   transition algorithm of subtract_with_carry_engine (\(TA(x_i)\)TA(x
   i)) is defined as follows:
    1. Let Y be \(X_{i-s}-X_{i-r}-c\)X
       i-s-X
       i-r-c.
    2. Let y be \(Y\mod 2^w\)Y mod 2w
       , and set \(X_i\)X
       i to y.
    3. If Y is negative, set c to 1, otherwise set c to 0.

   The generation algorithm of subtract_with_carry_engine is \(GA(x_i) =
   y\)GA(x
   i) = y, where y is the value produced in step 2 of the transition
   algorithm.

Predefined specializations

   The following specializations define the random number engine with two
   commonly used parameter sets:
