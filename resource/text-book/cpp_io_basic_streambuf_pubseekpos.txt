   Sets the position indicator of the input and/or output sequence to an
   absolute position.
   1) Calls seekpos(pos, which) of the most derived class.
   2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived
   classes may override this function to allow absolute positioning of the
   position indicator.

Parameters

   pos - absolute position to set the position indicator to
   which - defines which of the input and/or output sequences to affect.
   It can be one or a combination of the following constants:
   Constant Explanation
   in       affect the input sequence
   out      affect the output sequence

Return value

   1) The return value of seekpos(pos, which).
   2) The resulting absolute position as defined by the position
   indicator. The base class version returns pos_type(off_type(-1)).

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 55 C++98 the base class version of seekpos returned
   an undefined invalid stream position returns pos_type(off_type(-1))
