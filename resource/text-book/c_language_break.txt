   break
   continue
   return
   goto

   Causes the enclosing for, while or do-while loop or switch statement to
   terminate.

   Used when it is otherwise awkward to terminate the loop using the
   condition expression and conditional statements.

Syntax

   attr-spec-seq¿(optional) break ;
   attr-spec-seq - (C23) optional list of attributes, applied to the break
   statement

   Appears only within the statement of a loop body (while, do-while, for)
   or within the statement of a switch.

Explanation

   After this statement the control is transferred to the statement or
   declaration immediately following the enclosing loop or switch, as if
   by goto.

Keywords

   break

Notes

   A break statement cannot be used to break out of multiple nested loops.
   The goto statement may be used for this purpose.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int i = 2;
    switch (i)
    {
        case 1: printf("1");
        case 2: printf("2");   // i==2, so execution starts at this case label
        case 3: printf("3");
        case 4:
        case 5: printf("45");
                break;         // execution of subsequent cases is terminated
        case 6: printf("6");
    }
    printf("\n");

    // Compare outputs from these two nested for loops.
    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)
        for (int k = 0; k < 5; k++)
            printf("%d%d ", j,k);
    printf("\n");

    for (int j = 0; j < 2; j++)
    {
        for (int k = 0; k < 5; k++) // only this loop is exited by break
        {
            if (k == 2)
                break;
            printf("%d%d ", j,k);
        }
    }
}

   Possible output:
2345
00 01 02 03 04 10 11 12 13 14
00 01 10 11
