   void release() noexcept;
                           (library fundamentals TS v3)

   Releases the ownership of the managed resource if any. The destructor
   will not execute the deleter after the call, unless reset is called
   later for managing new resource.

   Unlike std::unique_ptr::release, this function is not required to
   modify the stored resource handle.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)
