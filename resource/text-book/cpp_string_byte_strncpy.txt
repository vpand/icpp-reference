   Defined in header <cstring>
   char* strncpy( char* dest, const char* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies at most count characters of the byte string pointed to by src
   (including the terminating null character) to character array pointed
   to by dest.

   If count is reached before the entire string src was copied, the
   resulting character array is not null-terminated.

   If, after copying the terminating null character from src, count is not
   reached, additional null characters are written to dest until the total
   of count characters have been written.

   If the strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.

Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the character array to copy to
   src   - pointer to the byte string to copy from
   count - maximum number of characters to copy

Return value

   dest

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const char* src = "hi";
    char dest[6] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f'};
    std::strncpy(dest, src, 5);

    std::cout << "The contents of dest are: ";
    for (char c : dest)
    {
        if (c)
            std::cout << c << ' ';
        else
            std::cout << "\\0" << ' ';
    }
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Output:
The contents of dest are: h i \0 \0 \0 f
