   void arrive_and_drop();
                          (concurrency TS)

   Arrive at the flex_barrier's synchronization point and remove the
   current thread from the set of participating threads. It is unspecified
   whether this function blocks until the completion phase has ended. If
   the function blocks, the calling thread may be chosen to execute the
   completion phase.

   The behavior is undefined if the calling thread is not in the set of
   participating threads of this flex_barrier.

   Calls to arrive_and_drop synchronizes with the start of the completion
   phase of the flex_barrier. If the call blocks, then the completion of
   the completion phase synchronizes with the return from the call.

   Calls to arrive_and_drop and arrive_and_wait never introduce data races
   with themselves or each other.

Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

Notes

   The completion phase will be executed even if every participating
   thread calls arrive_and_drop.

   After a thread calls arrive_and_drop on a flex_barrier, it cannot call
   any member function on that barrier except for the destructor, even if
   the function object invoked by the completion phase returns a positive
   value.
