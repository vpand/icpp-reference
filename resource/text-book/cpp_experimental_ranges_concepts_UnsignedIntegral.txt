   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >
   concept bool UnsignedIntegral = Integral<T> && !SignedIntegral<T>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept UnsignedIntegral<T> is satisfied if and only if T is an
   integral type and std::is_signed<T>::value is false.

Notes

   UnsignedIntegral<T> may be satisfied by a type that is not a unsigned
   integer type, for example, bool.
