   future<void> make_ready_future();
   (2)                                    (concurrency TS)
   1) If std::decay_t<T> is std::reference_wrapper<X>, then the type V is
   X&, otherwise, V is std::decay_t<T>.
   Creates a shared state of type V that is immediately ready, with the
   result constructed from std::forward<T>(value), then returns a
   std::experimental::future associated with that shared state.
   2) Creates a shared state of type void that is immediately ready, then
   returns a std::experimental::future associated with that shared state.

Return value

   A std::experimental::future associated with the shared state that is
   created.
