   Defined in header <filesystem>
   class recursive_directory_iterator;
                                      (since C++17)

   recursive_directory_iterator is a LegacyInputIterator that iterates
   over the directory_entry elements of a directory, and, recursively,
   over the entries of all subdirectories. The iteration order is
   unspecified, except that each directory entry is visited only once.

   By default, symlinks are not followed, but this can be enabled by
   specifying the directory option follow_directory_symlink at
   construction time.

   The special pathnames dot and dot-dot are skipped.

   If the recursive_directory_iterator reports an error or is advanced
   past the last directory entry of the top-level directory, it becomes
   equal to the default-constructed iterator, also known as the end
   iterator. Two end iterators are always equal, dereferencing or
   incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

   If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree
   after the recursive directory iterator has been created, it is
   unspecified whether the change would be observed through the iterator.

   If the directory structure contains cycles, the end iterator may be
   unreachable.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a recursive directory iterator
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   default destructor
   (public member function)

Observers

   operator*operator->
   accesses the pointed-to entry
   (public member function)
   options
   returns the currently active options that affect the iteration
   (public member function)
   depth
   returns the current recursion depth
   (public member function)
   recursion_pending
   checks whether the recursion is disabled for the current directory
   (public member function)

Modifiers

   operator=
   assigns contents
   (public member function)
   incrementoperator++
   advances to the next entry
   (public member function)
   pop
   moves the iterator one level up in the directory hierarchy
   (public member function)
   disable_recursion_pending
   disables recursion until the next increment
   (public member function)

Non-member functions

   begin(std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator)end(std::filesystem
   ::recursive_directory_iterator)
   range-based for loop support
   (function)

   Additionally, operator== and operator!= are(until C++20)operator==
   is(since C++20) provided as required by LegacyInputIterator.

   It is unspecified whether operator!= is provided because it can be
   synthesized from operator==, and(since C++20) whether an equality
   operator is a member or non-member.

Helper templates

   namespace std::ranges {

   template<>
   inline constexpr bool

   enable_borrowed_range<std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator> =
   true;
   }
                          (since C++20)
   namespace std::ranges {

   template<>
   inline constexpr bool
       enable_view<std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator> = true;
   }
                          (since C++20)

   These specializations for recursive_directory_iterator make it a
   borrowed_range and a view.

Notes

   A recursive_directory_iterator typically holds a reference-counted
   pointer (to satisfy shallow-copy semantics of LegacyInputIterator) to
   an implementation object, which holds:
     * a container (such as std::vector) of non-recursive
       directory_iterators that forms the recursion stack,
     * the recursion depth counter (accessible with depth()),
     * the directory options used at construction (accessible with
       options()),
     * the pending recursion flag (accessible with recursion_pending(),
       may be combined with the directory options to save space).

Example

   Run this code
#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main()
{
    std::filesystem::current_path(std::filesystem::temp_directory_path());
    std::filesystem::create_directories("sandbox/a/b");
    std::ofstream("sandbox/file1.txt");
    std::filesystem::create_symlink("a", "sandbox/syma");

    // Iterate over the std::filesystem::directory_entry elements explicitly
    auto entry_length{3UZ};
    for (const fs::directory_entry& dir_entry :
            fs::recursive_directory_iterator("sandbox"))
    {
        std::cout << dir_entry << '\n';
        if (auto l{dir_entry.path().string().length()}; entry_length < l)
            entry_length = l;
    }
    std::cout << std::string(entry_length + 2, '-') << '\n';

    // Iterate over the std::filesystem::directory_entry elements using `auto`
    for (auto const& dir_entry : fs::recursive_directory_iterator("sandbox"))
        std::cout << dir_entry << '\n';

    std::filesystem::remove_all("sandbox");
}

   Possible output:
"sandbox/syma"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/a"
"sandbox/a/b"
-------------------
"sandbox/syma"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/a"
"sandbox/a/b"
