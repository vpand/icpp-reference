   Defined in header <stdexcept>
   class out_of_range;

   Defines a type of object to be thrown as exception. It reports errors
   that are consequence of attempt to access elements out of defined
   range.

   It may be thrown by the member functions of std::bitset and
   std::basic_string, by std::stoi and std::stod families of functions,
   and by the bounds-checked member access functions (e.g. std::vector::at
   and std::map::at).

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new out_of_range object with the given message
   (public member function)
   operator=
   replaces the out_of_range object
   (public member function)

std::out_of_range::out_of_range

   out_of_range( const std::string& what_arg );
   (1)
   out_of_range( const char* what_arg );
   (2)
   out_of_range( const out_of_range& other );
   (3)                                         (noexcept since C++11)
   1) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string.
   After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg.c_str()) == 0.
   2) Constructs the exception object with what_arg as explanatory string.
   After construction, std::strcmp(what(), what_arg) == 0.
   3) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type
   std::out_of_range then std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0. No
   exception can be thrown from the copy constructor.

Parameters

   what_arg - explanatory string
   other    - another exception object to copy

Exceptions

   1,2) May throw std::bad_alloc.

Notes

   Because copying std::out_of_range is not permitted to throw exceptions,
   this message is typically stored internally as a separately-allocated
   reference-counted string. This is also why there is no constructor
   taking std::string&&: it would have to copy the content anyway.

   Before the resolution of LWG issue 254, the non-copy constructor can
   only accept std::string. It makes dynamic allocation mandatory in order
   to construct a std::string object.

   After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception
   class must have a publicly accessible copy constructor. It can be
   implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by
   what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

std::out_of_range::operator=

   out_of_range& operator=( const out_of_range& other );
                                                        (noexcept since C++11)

   Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have
   dynamic type std::out_of_range then std::strcmp(what(), other.what())
   == 0 after assignment. No exception can be thrown from the copy
   assignment operator.

Parameters

   other - another exception object to assign with

Return value

   *this

Notes

   After the resolution of LWG issue 471, a derived standard exception
   class must have a publicly accessible copy assignment operator. It can
   be implicitly defined as long as the explanatory strings obtained by
   what() are the same for the original object and the copied object.

Inherited from std::exception

Member functions

   (destructor)
   [virtual]
   destroys the exception object
   (virtual public member function of std::exception)
   what
   [virtual]
   returns an explanatory string
   (virtual public member function of std::exception)

Notes

   The standard error condition std::errc::result_out_of_range typically
   indicates the condition where the result, rather than the input, is out
   of range, and is more closely related to std::range_error and ERANGE.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 254 C++98 the constructor accepting const char* was missing added
   LWG 471 C++98 the explanatory strings of std::out_of_range's
   copies were implementation-defined they are the same as that of the
   original std::out_of_range object
