   mbstate_t
   (C95)

   Defined in header <uchar.h>
                              (since C11)
   Defined in header <wchar.h>
   struct mbstate_t;
                              (since C95)

   The type mbstate_t is a trivial non-array type that can represent any
   of the conversion states that can occur in an implementation-defined
   set of supported multibyte character encoding rules. Zero-initialized
   value of mbstate_t represents the initial conversion state, although
   other values of mbstate_t may exist that also represent the initial
   conversion state.

   Possible implementation of mbstate_t is a struct type holding an array
   representing the incomplete multibyte character, an integer counter
   indicating the number of bytes in the array that have been processed,
   and a representation of the current shift state.

   The following functions should not be called from multiple threads
   without synchronization with the mbstate_t* argument of a null pointer
   due to possible data races: mbrlen, mbrtowc, mbsrtowcs, mbtowc,
   wcrtomb, wcsrtombs, wctomb.
