   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/iterator>
   template< class I >

   concept bool Iterator =
       requires(I i) {
           { *i } -> auto&&; // Requires: i is dereferenceable
       } &&
       WeaklyIncrementable<I>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The Iterator concept forms the basis of the iterator concept taxonomy;
   every iterator satisfies the Iterator requirements.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.

Notes

   Iterator itself only specifies operations for dereferencing and
   incrementing an iterator. Most algorithms will require additional
   operations, for example:
     * comparing iterators with sentinels (see Sentinel);
     * reading values from an iterator (see Readable and InputIterator);
     * writing values to an iterator (see Writable and OutputIterator);
     * a richer set of iterator movements (see ForwardIterator,
       BidirectionalIterator, RandomAccessIterator).

   The -> auto&& constraint implies that the result type of the deference
   cannot be void.
