   friend std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits>&
       operator>>( std::basic_istream<CharT,Traits>& ist,
                   bernoulli_distribution& d );
   (2)                                  (since C++11)

   Performs stream input and output operations on pseudo-random number
   distribution d.
   1) Writes a textual representation of the distribution parameters and
   internal state to ost as textual representation. The formatting flags
   and fill character of ost are unchanged.
   2) Restores the distribution parameters and internal state with data
   read from ist. The formatting flags of ist are unchanged. The data must
   have been written using a stream with the same locale, CharT and Traits
   template parameters, otherwise the behavior is undefined. If bad input
   is encountered, ist.setstate(std::ios::failbit) is called, which may
   throw std::ios_base::failure. d is unchanged in that case.

   These function templates are not visible to ordinary unqualified or
   qualified lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup
   when std::bernoulli_distribution is an associated class of the
   arguments.

Parameters

   ost - output stream to insert the data to
   ist - input stream to extract the data from
   d   - pseudo-random number distribution

Return value

   1) ost
   2) ist

Exceptions

   1) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
   2) May throw std::ios_base::failure on bad input.

Defect reports

   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.

   unspecified
