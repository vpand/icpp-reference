   basic_ostream& write( const char_type* s, std::streamsize count );

   Behaves as an UnformattedOutputFunction. After constructing and
   checking the sentry object, outputs the characters from successive
   locations in the character array whose first element is pointed to by
   s. Characters are inserted into the output sequence until one of the
   following occurs:
     * exactly count characters are inserted
     * inserting into the output sequence fails (in which case
       setstate(badbit) is called).

Parameters

   s     - pointer to the character string to write
   count - number of characters to write

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and
   exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit
   is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

Notes

   This function is not overloaded for the types signed char or unsigned
   char, unlike the formatted operator<<.

   Also, unlike the formatted output functions, this function does not set
   the failbit on failure.

   When using a non-converting locale (the default locale is
   non-converting), the overrider of this function in std::basic_ofstream
   may be optimized for zero-copy bulk I/O (by means of overriding
   std::streambuf::xsputn).

Example

   This function may be used to output object representations, i.e. binary
   output
   Run this code
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int n = 0x41424344;
    std::cout.write(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&n), sizeof n) << '\n';

    char c[] = "This is sample text.";
    std::cout.write(c, 4).write("!\n", 2);
}

   Possible output:
DCBA
This!
