   Preprocessor
   #if#ifdef#ifndef#else#elif#elifdef#elifndef#endif
   (C23)(C23)
   #define#undef#,## operators
   #include__has_include
   (C23)
   #error#warning
   (C23)
   #pragma_Pragma

   (C23)(C23)

   Shows the given error message and renders the program ill-formed, or
   given warning message without affect the validity of the program(since
   C23).

Syntax

   #error diagnostic-message   (1)
   #warning diagnostic-message (2) (since C23)

Explanation

   1) After encountering the #error directive, an implementation displays
   the message diagnostic-message and renders the program ill-formed (the
   compilation stops).
   2) Same as (1), except that the validity of the program is not affected
   and the compilation continues.

   diagnostic-message can consist of several words not necessarily in
   quotes.

Notes

   Before its standardization in C23, #warning has been provided by many
   compilers in all modes as a conforming extension.

Example

   Run this code
#if __STDC__ != 1
#  error "Not a standard compliant compiler"
#endif

#if __STDC_VERSION__ >= 202311L
#  warning "Using #warning as a standard feature"
#endif

#include <stdio.h>
int main (void)
{
    printf("The compiler used conforms to the ISO C Standard !!");
}

   Possible output:
The compiler used conforms to the ISO C Standard !!
