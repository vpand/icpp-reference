   utilities that are provided by the C library.)

Boolean type

          + _Bool (also accessible as the macro bool)(until C23)bool(since
            C23) - type, capable of holding one of the two values: 1 and 0
            (also accessible as the macros true and false)(until C23)true
            and false(since C23).

   Note that conversion to _Bool(until C23)bool(since C23) does not work
   the same as conversion to other integer types: (bool)0.5 evaluates to
   true, whereas (int)0.5 evaluates to 0.
   (since C99)

Character types

          + signed char - type for signed character representation.
          + unsigned char - type for unsigned character representation.
            Also used to inspect object representations (raw memory).
          + char - type for character representation. Equivalent to either
            signed char or unsigned char (which one is
            implementation-defined and may be controlled by a compiler
            commandline switch), but char is a distinct type, different
            from both signed char and unsigned char.

   Note that the standard library also defines typedef names wchar_t ,
   char16_t and char32_t(since C11) to represent wide characters and
   char8_t for UTF-8 characters(since C23).

Integer types

          + short int (also accessible as short, may use the keyword
            signed)
          + unsigned short int (also accessible as unsigned short)
          + int (also accessible as signed int)

                This is the most optimal integer type for the platform,
                and is guaranteed to be at least 16 bits. Most current
                systems use 32 bits (see Data models below).

          + unsigned int (also accessible as unsigned), the unsigned
            counterpart of int, implementing modulo arithmetic. Suitable
            for bit manipulations.
          + long int (also accessible as long)
          + unsigned long int (also accessible as unsigned long)

          + long long int (also accessible as long long)
          + unsigned long long int (also accessible as unsigned long long)

   (since C99)

          + _BitInt(n) (also accessible as signed _BitInt(n)), the
            bit-precise signed integer types (where n is replaced by an
            integer constant expression denoting the precise width
            (including the sign bit), that cannot be larger than
            BITINT_MAXWIDTH from <limits.h>)
          + unsigned _BitInt(n), the bit-precise unsigned integer types
            (where n is replaced by an integer constant expression
            denoting the precise width, that cannot be larger than
            BITINT_MAXWIDTH from <limits.h>)

   (since C23)

   Note: as with all type specifiers, any order is permitted: unsigned
   long long int and long int unsigned long name the same type.

   The following table summarizes all available integer types and their
   properties:

   Besides the minimal bit counts, the C Standard guarantees that

          1 == sizeof(char) <= sizeof(short) <= sizeof(int) <=
          sizeof(long) <= sizeof(long long).

   Note: this allows the extreme case in which byte are sized 64 bits, all
   types (including char) are 64 bits wide, and sizeof returns 1 for every
   type.

   Note: integer arithmetic is defined differently for the signed and
   unsigned integer types. See arithmetic operators, in particular integer
   overflows.

Data models

   The choices made by each implementation about the sizes of the
   fundamental types are collectively known as data model. Four data
   models found wide acceptance:

   32 bit systems:

          + LP32 or 2/4/4 (int is 16-bit, long and pointer are 32-bit)

               o Win16 API

          + ILP32 or 4/4/4 (int, long, and pointer are 32-bit);

               o Win32 API
               o Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS X)

   64 bit systems:

          + LLP64 or 4/4/8 (int and long are 32-bit, pointer is 64-bit)

               o Win64 API

          + LP64 or 4/8/8 (int is 32-bit, long and pointer are 64-bit)

               o Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, Mac OS X)

   Other models are very rare. For example, ILP64 (8/8/8: int, long, and
   pointer are 64-bit) only appeared in some early 64-bit Unix systems
   (e.g. Unicos on Cray).

   Note that exact-width integer types are available in <stdint.h> since
   C99.

Real floating types

   C has three or six(since C23) types for representing real
   floating-point values:

          + float - single precision floating-point type. Matches IEEE-754
            binary32 format if supported.
          + double - double precision floating-point type. Matches
            IEEE-754 binary64 format if supported.
          + long double - extended precision floating-point type. Matches
            IEEE-754 binary128 format if supported, otherwise matches
            IEEE-754 binary64-extended format if supported, otherwise
            matches some non-IEEE-754 extended floating-point format as
            long as its precision is better than binary64 and range is at
            least as good as binary64, otherwise matches IEEE-754 binary64
            format.
               o binary128 format is used by some HP-UX, SPARC, MIPS,
                 ARM64, and z/OS implementations.
               o The most well known IEEE-754 binary64-extended format is
                 80-bit x87 extended precision format. It is used by many
                 x86 and x86-64 implementations (a notable exception is
                 MSVC, which implements long double in the same format as
                 double, i.e. binary64).

          If the implementation predefines the macro constant
          __STDC_IEC_60559_DFP__, the following decimal floating-point
          types are also supported.

          + _Decimal32 - Represents IEEE-754 decimal32 format.
          + _Decimal64 - Represents IEEE-754 decimal64 format.
          + _Decimal128 - Represents IEEE-754 decimal128 format.

          Otherwise, these decimal floating-point types are not supported.

   (since C23)

   Floating-point types may support special values:
     * infinity (positive and negative), see INFINITY
     * the negative zero, -0.0. It compares equal to the positive zero,
       but is meaningful in some arithmetic operations, e.g. 1.0/0.0 ==
       INFINITY, but 1.0/-0.0 == -INFINITY)
     * not-a-number (NaN), which does not compare equal with anything
       (including itself). Multiple bit patterns represent NaNs, see nan,
       NAN. Note that C takes no special notice of signaling NaNs
       (specified by IEEE-754), and treats all NaNs as quiet.

   Real floating-point numbers may be used with arithmetic operators + - /
   * and various mathematical functions from <math.h>. Both built-in
   operators and library functions may raise floating-point exceptions and
   set errno as described in math_errhandling.

   Floating-point expressions may have greater range and precision than
   indicated by their types, see FLT_EVAL_METHOD. Assignment, return, and
   cast force the range and precision to the one associated with the
   declared type.

   Floating-point expressions may also be contracted, that is, calculated
   as if all intermediate values have infinite range and precision, see
   #pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT.

   Some operations on floating-point numbers are affected by and modify
   the state of the floating-point environment (most notably, the rounding
   direction).

   Implicit conversions are defined between real floating types and
   integer, complex, and imaginary types.

   See Limits of floating-point types and the <math.h> library for
   additional details, limits, and properties of the floating-point types.

Complex floating types

   Complex floating types model the mathematical complex number, that is
   the numbers that can be written as a sum of a real number and a real
   number multiplied by the imaginary unit: a + bi

   The three complex types are

          + float _Complex (also available as float complex if <complex.h>
            is included)
          + double _Complex (also available as double complex if
            <complex.h> is included)
          + long double _Complex (also available as long double complex if
            <complex.h> is included)

   Note: as with all type specifiers, any order is permitted: long double
   complex, complex long double, and even double complex long name the
   same type.
   Run this code
#include <complex.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    double complex z = 1 + 2*I;
    z = 1 / z;
    printf("1/(1.0+2.0i) = %.1f%+.1fi\n", creal(z), cimag(z));
}

   Output:
1/(1.0+2.0i) = 0.2-0.4i

   If the macro constant __STDC_NO_COMPLEX__ is defined by the
   implementation, the complex types (as well as the library header
   <complex.h>) are not provided.
   (since C11)

   Each complex type has the same object representation and alignment
   requirements as an array of two elements of the corresponding real type
   (float for float complex, double for double complex, long double for
   long double complex). The first element of the array holds the real
   part, and the second element of the array holds the imaginary
   component.
float a[4] = {1, 2, 3, 4};
float complex z1, z2;
memcpy(&z1, a, sizeof z1); // z1 becomes 1.0 + 2.0i
memcpy(&z2, a+2, sizeof z2); // z2 becomes 3.0 + 4.0i

   Complex numbers may be used with arithmetic operators + - * and /,
   possibly mixed with imaginary and real numbers. There are many
   mathematical functions defined for complex numbers in <complex.h>. Both
   built-in operators and library functions may raise floating-point
   exceptions and set errno as described in math_errhandling.

   Increment and decrement are not defined for complex types.

   Relational operators are not defined for complex types (there is no
   notion of "less than").

   Reason: review other ops, link library
   Implicit conversions are defined between complex types and other
   arithmetic types.

   In order to support the one-infinity model of complex number
   arithmetic, C regards any complex value with at least one infinite part
   as an infinity even if its other part is a NaN, guarantees that all
   operators and functions honor basic properties of infinities and
   provides cproj to map all infinities to the canonical one (see
   arithmetic operators for the exact rules).
   Run this code
#include <complex.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    double complex z = (1 + 0*I) * (INFINITY + I*INFINITY);
//  textbook formula would give
//  (1+i0)(infty+iinfty) => (1×infty - 0×infty) + i(0×infty+1×infty) => NaN + I*
NaN
//  but C gives a complex infinity
    printf("%f%+f*i\n", creal(z), cimag(z));

//  textbook formula would give
//  cexp(infty+iNaN) => exp(infty)×(cis(NaN)) => NaN + I*NaN
//  but C gives  ±infty+i*nan
    double complex y = cexp(INFINITY + I*NAN);
    printf("%f%+f*i\n", creal(y), cimag(y));
}

   Possible output:
inf+inf*i
inf+nan*i

   C also treats multiple infinities so as to preserve directional
   information where possible, despite the inherent limitations of the
   Cartesian representation:

   multiplying the imaginary unit by real infinity gives the
   correctly-signed imaginary infinity: i × infty = iinfty. Also, i ×
   (infty - iinfty) = infty + iinfty indicates the reasonable quadrant.

Imaginary floating types

   Imaginary floating types model the mathematical imaginary numbers, that
   is numbers that can be written as a real number multiplied by the
   imaginary unit: bi The three imaginary types are

          + float _Imaginary (also available as float imaginary if
            <complex.h> is included)
          + double _Imaginary (also available as double imaginary if
            <complex.h> is included)
          + long double _Imaginary (also available as long double
            imaginary if <complex.h> is included)

   Note: as with all type specifiers, any order is permitted: long double
   imaginary, imaginary long double, and even double imaginary long name
   the same type.
   Run this code
#include <complex.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    double imaginary z = 3*I;
    z = 1 / z;
    printf("1/(3.0i) = %+.1fi\n", cimag(z));
}

   Output:
1/(3.0i) = -0.3i

   An implementation that defines __STDC_IEC_559_COMPLEX__ is recommended,
   but not required to support imaginary numbers. POSIX recommends
   checking if the macro _Imaginary_I is defined to identify imaginary
   number support.
   (until C11)

   Imaginary numbers are supported if __STDC_IEC_559_COMPLEX__(until
   C23)__STDC_IEC_60559_COMPLEX__(since C23) is defined.
   (since C11)

   Each of the three imaginary types has the same object representation
   and alignment requirement as its corresponding real type (float for
   float imaginary, double for double imaginary, long double for long
   double imaginary).

   Note: despite that, imaginary types are distinct and not compatible
   with their corresponding real types, which prohibits aliasing.

   Imaginary numbers may be used with arithmetic operators + - * and /,
   possibly mixed with complex and real numbers. There are many
   mathematical functions defined for imaginary numbers in <complex.h>.
   Both built-in operators and library functions may raise floating-point
   exceptions and set errno as described in math_errhandling.

   Increment and decrement are not defined for imaginary types.
   This section is incomplete
   Reason: review other ops, link library
   Implicit conversions are defined between imaginary types and other
   arithmetic types.

   The imaginary numbers make it possible to express all complex numbers
   using the natural notation x + I*y (where I is defined as
   _Imaginary_I). Without imaginary types, certain special complex values
   cannot be created naturally. For example, if I is defined as
   _Complex_I, then writing 0.0 + I*INFINITY gives NaN as the real part,
   and CMPLX(0.0, INFINITY) must be used instead. Same goes for the
   numbers with the negative zero imaginary component, which are
   meaningful when working with the library functions with branch cuts,
   such as csqrt: 1.0 - 0.0*I results in the positive zero imaginary
   component if I is defined as _Complex_I and the negative zero imaginary
   part requires the use of CMPLX or conj.

   Imaginary types also simplify implementations; multiplication of an
   imaginary by a complex can be implemented straightforwardly with two
   multiplications if the imaginary types are supported, instead of four
   multiplications and two additions.
   (since C99)

Range of values

   The following table provides a reference for the limits of common
   numeric representations.

   Prior to C23, the C Standard allowed any signed integer representation,
   and the minimum guaranteed range of N-bit signed integers was from
   \(\scriptsize -(2^{N-1}-1)\)-(2N-1
   -1) to \(\scriptsize +2^{N-1}-1\)+2N-1
   -1 (e.g. -127 to 127 for a signed 8-bit type), which corresponds to the
   limits of one's complement or sign-and-magnitude.

   However, all popular data models (including all of ILP32, LP32, LP64,
   LLP64) and almost all C compilers use two's complement representation
   (the only known exceptions are some compliers for UNISYS), and as of
   C23, it is the only representation allowed by the standard, with the
   guaranteed range from \(\scriptsize -2^{N-1}\)-2N-1
   to \(\scriptsize +2^{N-1}-1\)+2N-1
   -1 (e.g. -128 to 127 for a signed 8-bit type).
