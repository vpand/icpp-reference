   swap(std::basic_istringstream)
   (C++11)

   void swap( basic_istringstream& other );
                                           (since C++11)

   Exchanges the state of the stream with those of other.

   This is done by calling basic_istream<CharT, Traits>::swap(other) and
   rdbuf()->swap(*other.rdbuf()).

Parameters

   other - stream to exchange the state with

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
