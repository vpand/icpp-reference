   explicit basic_ispanstream( std::span<CharT> s, std::ios_base::openmode
   mode =
                                   std::ios_base::in );

   (4) (since C++23)

   Constructs a new basic_ispanstream.
   1) Uses the storage referenced by s as initial underlying buffer of the
   wrapped std::basic_spanbuf device. The wrapped std::basic_spanbuf
   object is constructed as basic_spanbuf<Char, Traits>(s, mode |
   std::ios_base::in).
   2) Uses the storage referenced by r after converted to std::span<const
   CharT> as initial underlying buffer of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf
   device. The wrapped std::basic_spanbuf object is opened in mode
   std::ios_base::in. This overload participates in overload resolution
   only if ROS models borrowed_range, std::convertible_to<ROS,
   std::span<CharT>> is false, and std::convertible_to<ROS,
   std::span<const CharT>> is true.
   3) Move constructor. Move constructs the std::basic_istream base
   subobject and the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf from those of rhs, and
   then calls set_rdbuf with the address of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf
   in *this to install it.
   4) Copy constructor is deleted. basic_ispanstream is not copyable.

Parameters

   s - std::span referencing the storage to be use as initial underlying
   buffer of stream
   r - borrowed_range to be use as initial underlying buffer of stream
   mode - specifies stream open mode. Following constants and bit-wise OR
   between them may be used:
   Constant          Explanation
   app               seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary            open in binary mode
   in                open for reading
   out               open for writing
   trunc             discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate               seek to the end of stream immediately after open
   noreplace (C++23) open in exclusive mode
   other - another basic_ispanstream to be moved from

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
