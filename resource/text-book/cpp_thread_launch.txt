   Defined in header <future>
   enum class launch : /* unspecified */ {

       async =    /* unspecified */,
       deferred = /* unspecified */,
       /* implementation-defined */
   };
                                          (since C++11)

   std::launch is a BitmaskType. It specifies the launch policy for a task
   executed by the std::async function.

   The following constants denoting individual bits are defined by the
   standard library:
   Constant Explanation
   std::launch::async the task is executed on a different thread,
   potentially by creating and launching it first
   std::launch::deferred the task is executed on the calling thread the
   first time its result is requested (lazy evaluation)

   In addition, implementations are allowed to:
     * define additional bits and bitmasks to specify restrictions on task
       interactions applicable to a subset of launch policies, and
     * enable those additional bitmasks for the first (default) overload
       of std::async.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 2102 C++11 std::launch was an implementation-defined type it is not
   implementation-defined

   (C++11)
   runs a function asynchronously (potentially in a new thread) and
   returns a std::future that will hold the result
   (function template)
