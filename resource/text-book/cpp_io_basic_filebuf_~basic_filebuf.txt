   virtual ~basic_filebuf();

   Calls close() to close the associated file and destructs all other
   members of basic_filebuf. If an exception occurs during the destruction
   of the object, including the call to close(), it is caught and not
   rethrown.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)

Notes

   Typically called by the destructor of std::basic_fstream.
