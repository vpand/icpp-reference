   1) A range adaptor consisting of elements of the underlying sequence,
   skipping the first N elements.
   2) RangeAdaptorObject. Given T is std::remove_cvref_t<decltype((e))>
   and D is ranges::range_difference_t<decltype((e))>), the expression
   views::drop(e, f) is expression-equivalent to:
     * ((void)f, decay-copy(e)), if T is a ranges::empty_view, except that
       the evaluations of e and f are indeterminately sequenced;
     * otherwise, T(ranges::begin(e) + inc, ranges::end(e),
         /* to-unsigned-like */(ranges::distance(e) - inc)), if T is a
       specialization of ranges::subrange that models both
       random_access_range and sized_range, and T needs to store the size
       (see ranges::subrange::subrange for details), where inc is
       std::min<D>(ranges::distance(e), f);
     * otherwise, U(ranges::begin(e) + inc, ranges::end(e)), if T is a
       specialization of std::span, std::basic_string_view,
       ranges::iota_view, or ranges::subrange that models both
       random_access_range and sized_range, where U is

          + std::span<typename T::element_type>, if T is a specialization
            of std::span;
          + T otherwise;

     * otherwise, if T is a specialization of ranges::repeat_view:

          + views::repeat(*e.value_, ranges::distance(e) - inc), if T
            models sized_range; in such case e is evaluated only once;
          + ((void)e, auto(f)) otherwise, except that the evaluations of e
            and f are indeterminately sequenced;

   (since C++23)
     * otherwise, drop_view(e, f).

   In all cases, decltype((f)) must model std::convertible_to<D>.

   drop_view models the concepts contiguous_range, random_access_range,
   bidirectional_range, forward_range, input_range, common_range, and
   sized_range when the underlying view V models respective concepts.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   (C++20)
   constructs a drop_view
   (public member function)
   base
   (C++20)
   returns a copy of the underlying (adapted) view
   (public member function)
   begin
   (C++20)
   returns an iterator to the beginning
   (public member function)
   end
   (C++20)
   returns an iterator or a sentinel to the end
   (public member function)
   size
   (C++20)
   returns the number of elements. Provided only if the underlying
   (adapted) range satisfies sized_range.
   (public member function)

Inherited from std::ranges::view_interface

   empty
   (C++20)
   returns whether the derived view is empty. Provided if it satisfies
   sized_range or forward_range.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)
   cbegin
   (C++23)
   returns a constant iterator to the beginning of the range.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)
   cend
   (C++23)
   returns a sentinel for the constant iterator of the range.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)
   operator bool
   (C++20)
   returns whether the derived view is not empty. Provided if
   ranges::empty is applicable to it.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)
   data
   (C++20)
   gets the address of derived view's data. Provided if its iterator type
   satisfies contiguous_iterator.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)
   front
   (C++20)
   returns the first element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies
   forward_range.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)
   back
   (C++20)
   returns the last element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies
   bidirectional_range and common_range.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)
   operator[]
   (C++20)
   returns the n^th element in the derived view. Provided if it satisfies
   random_access_range.
   (public member function of std::ranges::view_interface<D>)

Helper templates

   template<class T>

   inline constexpr bool enable_borrowed_range<std::ranges::drop_view<T>>
   =
       std::ranges::enable_borrowed_range<T>;
                    (since C++20)

   This specialization of std::ranges::enable_borrowed_range makes
   drop_view satisfy borrowed_range when the underlying view satisfies it.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <ranges>

int main()
{
    const auto nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7};

    std::cout << "drop " << 2 << ": ";
    for (int i : std::ranges::drop_view{nums, 2})
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';

    std::cout << "drop " << 3 << ": ";
    for (int i : nums | std::views::drop(3))
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';

    std::cout << "drop " << 4 << ": ";
    for (int i : std::views::iota(1, 8) | std::views::drop(4))
        std::cout << i << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';

    // Note that dropping more than the number of elements is OK:
    for (int dp : {5, 6, 7, 890, 100500})
    {
        std::cout << "drop " << dp << ": ";
        for (int i : std::views::iota(1, 8) | std::views::drop(dp))
            std::cout << i << ' ';
        std::cout << '\n';
    }
}

   Output:
drop 2: 3 4 5 6 7
drop 3: 4 5 6 7
drop 4: 5 6 7
drop 5: 6 7
drop 6: 7
drop 7:
drop 890:
drop 100500:
