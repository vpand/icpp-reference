   Defined in header <stdatomic.h>
   void atomic_thread_fence( memory_order order );
                                                  (since C11)

   Establishes memory synchronization ordering of non-atomic and relaxed
   atomic accesses, as instructed by order, without an associated atomic
   operation. For example, all non-atomic and relaxed atomic stores that
   happen before a memory_order_release fence in thread A will be
   synchronized with non-atomic and relaxed atomic loads from the same
   locations made in thread B after an memory_order_acquire fence.

Parameters

   order - the memory ordering executed by this fence

Return value

   (none)
