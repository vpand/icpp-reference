   Defined in header <cwchar>
   std::wint_t ungetwc( std::wint_t ch, std::FILE* stream );

   If ch does not equal WEOF, pushes the wide character ch into the input
   buffer associated with the stream stream in such a manner than
   subsequent read operation from stream will retrieve that wide
   character. The external device associated with the stream is not
   modified.

   Stream repositioning operations std::fseek, std::fsetpos, and
   std::rewind discard the effects of std::ungetwc.

   If std::ungetwc is called more than once without an intervening read or
   repositioning, it may fail (in other words, a pushback buffer of size 1
   is guaranteed, but any larger buffer is implementation-defined). If
   multiple successful std::ungetwc were performed, read operations
   retrieve the pushed-back wide characters in reverse order of
   std::ungetwc

   If ch equals WEOF, the operation fails and the stream is not affected.

   A successful call to std::ungetwc clears the end of file status flag
   feof.

   A successful call to std::ungetwc on a stream (whether text or binary)
   modifies the stream position indicator in unspecified manner but
   guarantees that after all pushed-back wide characters are retrieved
   with a read operation, the stream position indicator is equal to its
   value before std::ungetwc.

Parameters

   ch     - wide character to be put back
   stream - file stream to put the wide character back to

Return value

   On success ch is returned.

   On failure WEOF is returned and the given stream remains unchanged.
