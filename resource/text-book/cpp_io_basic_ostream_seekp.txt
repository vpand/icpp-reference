   basic_ostream& seekp( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir );
   (2)

   Sets the output position indicator of the current associated streambuf
   object.

   Behaves as UnformattedOutputFunction (except without actually
   performing output). After constructing and checking the sentry object,
   (since C++11)
   1) if fail() != true, sets the output position indicator to absolute
   (relative to the beginning of the file) value pos by calling
   rdbuf()->pubseekpos(pos, std::ios_base::out). In case of failure, calls
   setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).
   2) if fail() != true, sets the output position indicator to offset off
   relative to dir by calling rdbuf()->pubseekoff(off, dir,
   std::ios_base::out). In case of failure, calls
   setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).

Parameters

   pos - absolute position to set the output position indicator to
   off - relative position (positive or negative) to set the output
   position indicator to
   dir - defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be
   one of the following constants:
   Constant Explanation
   beg      the beginning of a stream
   end      the ending of a stream
   cur      the current position of stream position indicator

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   1,2) May throw std::ios_base::failure in case of failure, if
   exceptions() & failbit != 0.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::ostringstream os("hello, world");
    os.seekp(7);
    os << 'W';
    os.seekp(0, std::ios_base::end);
    os << '!';
    os.seekp(0);
    os << 'H';
    std::cout << os.str() << '\n';
}

   Output:
Hello, World!

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 129 C++98 there was no way to indicate a failure sets failbit on
   failure
   LWG 136 C++98 seekp could set the input stream only sets the output
   stream
   LWG 537 C++98 1. the type of pos was pos_type&
   2. the type of off was off_type& 1. corrected to pos_type
   2. corrected to off_type
   LWG 2341 C++98 the resolution of LWG issue 129 for overload (2) was
   removed restored
