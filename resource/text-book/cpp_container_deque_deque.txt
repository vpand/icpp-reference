   Constructs a new container from a variety of data sources, optionally
   using a user supplied allocator alloc.
   1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty container with a
   default-constructed allocator.
   2) Constructs an empty container with the given allocator alloc.
   3) Constructs the container with count copies of elements with value
   value.
   4) Constructs the container with count default-inserted instances of T.
   No copies are made.
   5) Constructs the container with the contents of the range
   [first, last).

   This constructor has the same effect as
   deque(static_cast<size_type>(first), static_cast<value_type>(last), a)
   if InputIt is an integral type.
   (until C++11)

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if InputIt
   satisfies LegacyInputIterator, to avoid ambiguity with the overload
   (3).
   (since C++11)
   6) Copy constructor. Constructs the container with the copy of the
   contents of other.

   The allocator is obtained as if by calling
   std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::select_on_container_copy_constru
   ction(
       other.get_allocator()).
   (since C++11)
   7) Constructs the container with the copy of the contents of other,
   using alloc as the allocator.

   During class template argument deduction, only the first argument
   contributes to the deduction of the container's Allocator template
   parameter.
   (since C++23)
   8) Move constructor. Constructs the container with the contents of
   other using move semantics. Allocator is obtained by move-construction
   from the allocator belonging to other.
   9) Allocator-extended move constructor. Using alloc as the allocator
   for the new container, moving the contents from other; if alloc !=
   other.get_allocator(), this results in an element-wise move.

   During class template argument deduction, only the first argument
   contributes to the deduction of the container's Allocator template
   parameter.
   (since C++23)
   10) Constructs the container with the contents of the initializer list
   init.
   11) Constructs the container with the contents of the range rg.

Parameters

   alloc - allocator to use for all memory allocations of this container
   count - the size of the container
   value - the value to initialize elements of the container with
   first, last - the range [first, last) to copy the elements from
   other - another container to be used as source to initialize the
   elements of the container with
   init - initializer list to initialize the elements of the container
   with
   rg - a container compatible range, that is, an input_range whose
   elements are convertible to T

Complexity

   1,2) Constant.
   3,4) Linear in count.
   5) Linear in distance between first and last.
   6,7) Linear in size of other.
   8) Constant.
   9) Linear if alloc != other.get_allocator(), otherwise constant.
   10) Linear in size of init.
   11) Linear in ranges::distance(rg).

Exceptions

   Calls to Allocator::allocate may throw.

Notes

   After container move construction (overload (8)), references, pointers,
   and iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain valid, but
   refer to elements that are now in *this. The current standard makes
   this guarantee via the blanket statement in [container.reqmts]/67, and
   a more direct guarantee is under consideration via LWG issue 2321.
   Feature-test macro Value Std Feature
   __cpp_lib_containers_ranges 202202L (C++23) Ranges-aware construction
   and insertion; overload (11)

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <deque>

template<typename T>
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& s, const std::deque<T>& v)
{
    s.put('{');
    for (char comma[]{'\0', ' ', '\0'}; const auto& e : v)
        s << comma << e, comma[0] = ',';
    return s << "}\n";
}

int main()
{
    // C++11 initializer list syntax:
    std::deque<std::string> words1{"the", "frogurt", "is", "also", "cursed"};
    std::cout << "1: " << words1;

    // words2 == words1
    std::deque<std::string> words2(words1.begin(), words1.end());
    std::cout << "2: " << words2;

    // words3 == words1
    std::deque<std::string> words3(words1);
    std::cout << "3: " << words3;

    // words4 is {"Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo", "Mo"}
    std::deque<std::string> words4(5, "Mo");
    std::cout << "4: " << words4;

    auto const rg = {"cat", "cow", "crow"};
#ifdef __cpp_lib_containers_ranges
    std::deque<std::string> words5(std::from_range, rg); // overload (11)
#else
    std::deque<std::string> words5(rg.begin(), rg.end()); // overload (5)
#endif
    std::cout << "5: " << words5;
}

   Output:
1: {the, frogurt, is, also, cursed}
2: {the, frogurt, is, also, cursed}
3: {the, frogurt, is, also, cursed}
4: {Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo, Mo}
5: {cat, cow, crow}

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 144 C++98 the complexity requirement of overload (5) was the same
   as that of the corresponding overload of std::vector changed to linear
   complexity
   LWG 237 C++98 the complexity requirement of overload
   (5) was linear in first - last changed to linear in
   std::distance(first, last)
   LWG 868 C++98 for overload (4), the elements in the container were
   default constructed they are value-initialized
   LWG 2193 C++11 the default constructor is explicit made non-explicit
