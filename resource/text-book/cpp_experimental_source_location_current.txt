   static constexpr source_location current() noexcept;
   (library fundamentals TS v2)

   Constructs a new source_location object.

Return value

   If current() is invoked directly (via a function call that names
   current()), it returns a source_location object with
   implementation-defined values representing the location of the call.
   The values should be affected by the #line preprocessor directive in
   the same manner as the predefined macros __LINE__ and __FILE__.

   If current() is invoked in any other manner, the return value is
   unspecified.

Remarks

   If current() is used in an initializer for a non-static data member,
   the return value corresponds to the location of the constructor or
   aggregate initialization that initializes the data member.

Notes

   When current() is used in a default argument, the return value will
   correspond to the location of the call to current() at the call site.

Parameters

   (none)
