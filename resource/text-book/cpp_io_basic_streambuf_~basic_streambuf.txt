   virtual ~basic_streambuf();

   This destructor has no effect: the members of this basic_streambuf (the
   pointers and the locale) are destructed in accordance with the usual
   object destruction sequence after this destructor returns. However,
   since it is declared public virtual, it allows the objects that are
   derived from std::basic_streambuf to be deleted through a pointer to
   base class.

Parameters

   (none)

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::filebuf* fbp = new std::filebuf;
    fbp->open("test.txt", std::ios_base::out);
    fbp->sputn("Hello\n", 6);

    std::streambuf* sbp = fbp;
    delete sbp; // the file is closed, output flushed and written

    std::ifstream f("test.txt");
    std::cout << f.rdbuf(); // proof
}

   Output:
Hello
