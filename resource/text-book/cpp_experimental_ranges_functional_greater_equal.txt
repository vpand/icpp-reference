   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/functional>
   template< class T = void >

       requires StrictTotallyOrdered<T> ||
                Same<T, void> ||
                /* < on two const T lvalues invokes a built-in operator
   comparing pointers */

                                                     (ranges TS)

   Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template
   invokes operator< on const lvalues of type T and negates the result.
   The specialization greater_equal<void> deduces the parameter types of
   the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return
   type).

   All specializations of greater_equal are Semiregular.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   is_transparent (member only of greater_equal<void> specialization) /*
   unspecified */

Member functions

   operator()
   checks if the first argument is greater than or equal to the second
   (public member function)

std::experimental::ranges::greater_equal::operator()

   constexpr bool operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const;
   (1) (member only of primary greater_equal<T> template)
   template< class T, class U >

       requires StrictTotallyOrderedWith<T, U> ||
                /* std::declval<T>() < std::declval<U>() resolves to
                   a built-in operator comparing pointers */
   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;
   (2) (member only of greater_equal<void> specialization)
   1) Compares x and y. Equivalent to return !ranges::less<>{}(x, y);.
   2) Compares t and u. Equivalent to return
   !ranges::less<>{}(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<U>(u));.

Notes

   Unlike std::greater_equal, ranges::greater_equal requires all six
   comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the
   StrictTotallyOrdered and StrictTotallyOrderedWith constraints) and is
   entirely defined in terms of ranges::less. However, the implementation
   is free to use operator>= directly, because those concepts require the
   results of the comparison operators to be consistent.
