   Defined in header <experimental/random>
   template< class IntType >
   IntType randint( IntType a, IntType b );
                                          (library fundamentals TS v2)

   Generates a random integer in the closed interval [a, b].

Parameters

   a, b - integer values specifying the range

Return value

   A random integer i in the closed interval [a, b], produced using a
   thread-local instance of std::uniform_int_distribution<IntType> invoked
   with the per-thread random number engine.

Remarks

   If IntType is not one of short, int, long, long long, unsigned short,
   unsigned int, unsigned long, or unsigned long long, the program is
   ill-formed.

   The behavior is undefined if a > b.

Example

   Run this code
#include <experimental/random>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int random_number = std::experimental::randint(100, 999);
    std::cout << "random 3-digit number: " << random_number << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
random 3-digit number: 273
