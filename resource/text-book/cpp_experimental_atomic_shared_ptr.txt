   Defined in header <experimental/atomic>
   template< class T >
   class atomic_shared_ptr;
                                          (concurrency TS)

   The class template atomic_shared_ptr provides thread-safe atomic
   pointer operations over a std::shared_ptr. It provides a better
   alternative to the non-member shared_ptr atomic access functions.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs an atomic_shared_ptr object
   (public member function)
   operator=
   stores a value into an atomic_shared_ptr object
   (public member function)
   is_lock_free
   checks if the atomic_shared_ptr object is lock-free
   (public member function)
   store
   atomically replaces the value of the atomic object with a non-atomic
   argument
   (public member function)
   load
   atomically obtains the value of the atomic object
   (public member function)
   operator shared_ptr<T>
   loads a value from an atomic object
   (public member function)
   exchange
   atomically replaces the value of the atomic object and obtains the
   value held previously
   (public member function)
   compare_exchange_weakcompare_exchange_strong
   atomically compares the value of the atomic object with non-atomic
   argument and performs atomic exchange if equal or atomic load if not
   (public member function)
