   The type must work with == operator and the result should have standard
   semantics.

Requirements

   The type T satisfies EqualityComparable if

   Given
     * a, b and c, expressions of type T or(since C++11) const T.

   The following expressions must be valid and have their specified
   effects:
   Expression           Return type                Requirements
   a == b     implicitly convertible to bool Establishes an equivalence
   relation, that is, it satisfies the following properties:
     * For all values of a, a == a yields true.
     * If a == b, then b == a.
     * If a == b and b == c, then a == c.

Notes

   To satisfy this requirement, types that do not have built-in comparison
   operators have to provide a user-defined operator==.

   For the types that are both EqualityComparable and LessThanComparable,
   the C++ standard library makes a distinction between equality, which is
   the value of the expression a == b and equivalence, which is the value
   of the expression !(a < b) && !(b < a).

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 283 C++98 even if T is EqualityComparable, the requirements did not
   apply to const T objects they apply to const T instead of T
