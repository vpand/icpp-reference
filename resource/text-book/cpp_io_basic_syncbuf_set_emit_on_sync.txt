   void set_emit_on_sync( bool b ) noexcept;

   Changes the current emit-on-sync policy.

   The value false (the default) indicates that any flush will be
   postponed until a call to emit.

   The value true makes flushes apply immediately.

Parameters

   b - new value for the emit-on-sync policy
