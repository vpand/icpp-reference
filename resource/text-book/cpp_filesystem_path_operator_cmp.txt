   (7) (since C++20)

   Compares two paths lexicographically.
   1) Checks whether lhs and rhs are equal. Equivalent to !(lhs < rhs) &&
   !(rhs < lhs).
   2) Checks whether lhs and rhs are not equal. Equivalent to !(lhs ==
   rhs).
   3) Checks whether lhs is less than rhs. Equivalent to lhs.compare(rhs)
   < 0.
   4) Checks whether lhs is less than or equal to rhs. Equivalent to !(rhs
   < lhs).
   5) Checks whether lhs is greater than rhs. Equivalent to rhs < lhs.
   6) Checks whether lhs is greater than or equal to rhs. Equivalent to
   !(lhs < rhs).
   7) Obtains the three-way comparison result of lhs and rhs. Equivalent
   to lhs.compare(rhs) <=> 0.

   These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified
   lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when
   std::filesystem::path is an associated class of the arguments. This
   prevents undesirable conversions in the presence of a using namespace
   std::filesystem; using-directive.

   The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and
   operator== respectively.
   (since C++20)

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - the paths to compare

Return value

   1-6) true if the corresponding comparison yields, false otherwise.
   7) std::strong_ordering::less if lhs is less than rhs, otherwise
   std::strong_ordering::greater if rhs is less than lhs, otherwise
   std::strong_ordering::equal.

Notes

   Path equality and equivalence have different semantics.

   In the case of equality, as determined by operator==, only lexical
   representations are compared. Therefore, path("a") == path("b") is
   never true.

   In the case of equivalence, as determined by
   std::filesystem::equivalent(), it is checked whether two paths resolve
   to the same file system object. Thus equivalent("a", "b") will return
   true if the paths resolve to the same file.
