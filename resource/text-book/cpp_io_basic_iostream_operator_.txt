   Member functions
   basic_iostream::basic_iostream
   basic_iostream::~basic_iostream
   Protected member functions
   basic_iostream::operator=
   basic_iostream::swap

 basic_iostream& operator=( const basic_iostream& other ) = delete;
 (1)
   protected:
   basic_iostream& operator=( basic_iostream&& other );
 (2)                                                               (since C++11)

   Assigns another stream object.
   1) Copy assignment is not allowed.
   2) Move assigns another stream object. Effectively calls swap(rhs).
   This move assignment operator is protected: it is called by the move
   assignment operators of the derived stream classes
   std::basic_stringstream and std::basic_fstream which know how to
   properly move-assign the associated stream buffers.

Parameters

   other - another stream to assign state of

Return value

   *this
