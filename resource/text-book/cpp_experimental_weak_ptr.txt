   std::experimental::weak_ptr
   weak_ptr::weak_ptr
   Members and non-members identical to those of std::weak_ptr

   Defined in header <experimental/memory>
   template< class T > class weak_ptr;
                                          (library fundamentals TS)

   std::experimental::weak_ptr is a modified version of std::weak_ptr that
   interoperates with std::experimental::shared_ptr and has support for
   arrays.

Member types

   Member type  Definition
   element_type std::remove_extent_t<T>

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs new weak_ptr
   (public member function)

Members and non-members identical to std::weak_ptr

Member functions

   The following member functions work with std::experimental::shared_ptr
   instead of std::shared_ptr and std::experimental::weak_ptr instead of
   std::weak_ptr. The behavior is otherwise identical.
   (destructor)
   destroys a weak_ptr
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)
   operator=
   assigns the weak_ptr
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

Modifiers

   reset
   releases the ownership of the managed object
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)
   swap
   swaps the managed objects
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

Observers

   use_count
   returns the number of shared_ptr objects that manage the object
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)
   expired
   checks whether the referenced object was already deleted
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)
   lock
   creates a shared_ptr that manages the referenced object
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)
   owner_before
   provides owner-based ordering of weak pointers
   (public member function of std::weak_ptr<T>)

Non-member functions

   This non-member function is declared in the std::experimental
   namespace, and work with std::experimental::weak_ptr rather than
   std::weak_ptr, but otherwise behaves identically to the corresponding
   C++14 function.
   std::swap(std::weak_ptr)
   (C++11)
   specializes the std::swap algorithm
   (function template)
