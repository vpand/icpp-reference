   size_type find( const StringViewLike& t,
                   size_type pos = 0 ) const noexcept(/* see below */);
   (5) (since C++17)
   (constexpr since C++20)

   Finds the first substring equal to the given character sequence. Search
   begins at pos, i.e. the found substring must not begin in a position
   preceding pos.
   1) Finds the first substring equal to str.
   2) Finds the first substring equal to the range [s, s + count). This
   range may contain null characters.
   If [s, s + count) is not a valid range, the behavior is undefined.
   3) Finds the first substring equal to the character string pointed to
   by s. The length of the string is determined by the first null
   character using Traits::length(s).
   If [s, s + Traits::length(s)) is not a valid range, the behavior is
   undefined.
   4) Finds the first character ch (treated as a single-character
   substring by the formal rules below).
   5) Implicitly converts t to a string view sv as if by
   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> sv = t;, then finds the first
   substring equal to sv.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&,
                         std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>> is true
   and std::is_convertible_v<const StringViewLike&, const CharT*> is
   false.

   Formally, a substring str is said to be found at position xpos if all
   of the following are true:
     * xpos >= pos
     * xpos + str.size() <= size()
     * for all positions n in str, Traits::eq(at(xpos + n), str.at(n)).

   In particular, this implies that
     * a substring can be found only if pos <= size() - str.size()
     * an empty substring is found at pos if and only if pos <= size()
     * for a non-empty substring, if pos >= size(), the function always
       returns npos.

Parameters

   str   - string to search for
   pos   - position at which to start the search
   count - length of substring to search for
   s     - pointer to a character string to search for
   ch    - character to search for
   t     - object (convertible to std::basic_string_view) to search for

Return value

   Position of the first character of the found substring or npos if no
   such substring is found.

Exceptions

   1,4) Throws nothing.
   5)
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_convertible_v<const T&,
   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>>)

   If an exception is thrown for any reason, this function has no effect
   (strong exception safety guarantee).

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

void print(int id, std::string::size_type n, std::string const& s)
{
    std::cout << id << ") ";
    if (std::string::npos == n)
        std::cout << "not found! n == npos\n";
    else
        std::cout << "found @ n = " << n << ", substr(" << n << ") = "
                  << std::quoted(s.substr(n)) << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::string::size_type n;
    std::string const s = "This is a string"; /*
                             ^  ^  ^
                             1  2  3          */

    // search from beginning of string
    n = s.find("is");
    print(1, n, s);

    // search from position 5
    n = s.find("is", 5);
    print(2, n, s);

    // find a single character
    n = s.find('a');
    print(3, n, s);

    // find a single character
    n = s.find('q');
    print(4, n, s);
}

   Output:
1) found @ n = 2, substr(2) = "is is a string"
2) found @ n = 5, substr(5) = "is a string"
3) found @ n = 8, substr(8) = "a string"
4) not found! n == npos

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 847 C++98 there was no exception safety guarantee added strong
   exception safety guarantee
   LWG 2064 C++11 overloads (3,4) were noexcept removed
   LWG 2946 C++17 overload (5) caused ambiguity in some cases avoided by
   making it a template
   P1148R0 C++11
   C++17 noexcept for overloads (4,5) were
   accidently dropped by LWG2064/LWG2946 restored
