   protected:
   basic_ostream& operator=( const basic_ostream& rhs ) = delete;
   (1)
   protected:
   basic_ostream& operator=( basic_ostream&& rhs );
   (2)       (since C++11)
   1) The copy assignment operator is protected, and is deleted. Output
   streams are not CopyAssignable.
   2) The move assignment operator exchanges all data members of the base
   class, except for rdbuf(), with rhs, as if by calling swap(*rhs). This
   move assignment operator is protected: it is only called by the move
   assignment operators of the derived movable output stream classes
   std::basic_ofstream and std::basic_ostringstream, which know how to
   correctly move-assign the associated streambuffers.

Parameters

   rhs - the basic_ostream object from which to assign to *this

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <utility>

int main()
{
    std::ostringstream s;
//  std::cout = s;            // ERROR: copy assignment operator is deleted
//  std::cout = std::move(s); // ERROR: move assignment operator is protected
    s = std::move(std::ostringstream() << 42); // OK, moved through derived
    std::cout << s.str() << '\n';
}

   Output:
42
