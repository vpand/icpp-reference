   Defined in header <experimental/numeric>
   template< class M, class N>
   constexpr std::common_type_t<M, N> gcd( M m, N n );
                                           (library fundamentals TS v2)

   Computes the greatest common divisor of the integers m and n.

Parameters

   m, n - integer values

Return value

   If both m and n are zero, returns zero. Otherwise, returns the greatest
   common divisor of |m| and |n|.

Remarks

   If either M or N is not an integer type, or if either is (possibly
   cv-qualified) bool, the program is ill-formed.

   If either |m| or |n| is not representable as a value of type
   std::common_type_t<M, N>, the behavior is undefined.

Exceptions

   Throws no exceptions.
