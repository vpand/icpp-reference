   Defined in header <locale>
   class codecvt_base;

   The class std::codecvt_base provides the conversion status constants
   which are inherited and used by the std::codecvt facets.

Member types

   Member type                                 Definition
   enum result { ok, partial, error, noconv }; Unscoped enumeration type
   Value   Explanation
   ok      conversion was completed with no error
   partial not all source characters were converted
   error   encountered an invalid character
   noconv  no conversion required, input and output types are the same

Notes

   The value std::codecvt_base::partial is used to indicate that either
   the destination range is too short to receive the results of the
   conversion or the input is truncated in the middle of an otherwise
   valid multibyte character.
