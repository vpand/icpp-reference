   timespec
   (C11)

   Defined in header <time.h>
   int timespec_getres( struct timespec *ts, int base );
                                                        (since C23)

   If ts is non-null and base is supported by timespec_get, modifies *ts
   to hold the resolution of time provided by timespec_get for base. For
   each supported base, multiple calls to timespec_getres during the same
   program execution have identical results.

Parameters

   ts - pointer to an object of type struct timespec
   base - TIME_UTC or another nonzero integer value indicating the time
   base

Return value

   The value of base if base is supported, zero otherwise.

Notes

   The POSIX function clock_getres(clock_id, ts) may also be used to
   populate a timespec with the resolution of time identified by clock_id.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void)
{
    char buff[128];
    struct timespec ts;
    const int res = timespec_getres(&ts, TIME_UTC);
    if (res == TIME_UTC) {
        struct tm timer;
        strftime(buff, sizeof buff, "%D %T", gmtime_r(&ts.tv_sec, &timer));
        printf("Time resolution info: %s.%09ld UTC\n", buff, ts.tv_nsec);
    } else {
        printf("TIME_UTC base is not supported.");
    }
}

   Possible output:
Time resolution info: 01/01/70 00:00:00.000000001 UTC
