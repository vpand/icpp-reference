   Move assigns the file stream other to *this, effectively move-assigning
   both the std::basic_iostream base class and the associated
   std::basic_filebuf.

   other is left with no associated file. Note that the base class move
   assignment swaps all stream state variables (except for rdbuf) between
   *this and other.

Parameters

   other - file stream to move

Return value

   *this
