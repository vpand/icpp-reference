   Call signature
   template< Iterator I >
   constexpr void advance( I& i, ranges::difference_type_t<I> n );
   (1)
   template< Iterator I, Sentinel<I> S >
   constexpr void advance( I& i, S bound );
   (2)
   template< Iterator I, Sentinel<I> S >
   constexpr ranges::difference_type_t<I> advance( I& i,
   ranges::difference_type_t<I> n, S bound );
   (3)

   Advances the iterator i n times, or until bound is reached, whichever
   comes first.
   1) If I models RandomAccessIterator, equivalent to i += n. Otherwise,
   increments (or decrements if n is negative) i n times. The behavior is
   undefined if n is negative and I does not model BidirectionalIterator.
   2) If Assignable<I&, S> is satisfied, equivalent to i =
   std::move(bound).
   Otherwise, if [i, bound) does not denote a range, the behavior is
   undefined.
   Otherwise, if SizedSentinel<S, I> is satisfied, equivalent to
   ranges::advance(i, bound - i).
   Otherwise, increments i until i == bound.
   3) If SizedSentinel<S, I> is satisfied, equivalent to
   ranges::advance(i, bound) if |n| >= |bound - i|, and ranges::advance(i,
   n) otherwise.
   Otherwise, increments (or decrements if n is negative) i either n times
   or until i == bound, whichever comes first.
   If n > 0, [i, bound) shall denote a range; if n == 0, either [i, bound)
   or [bound, i) shall denote a range; if n < 0, [bound, i) shall denote a
   range, I and S shall be the same type, and I must model
   BidirectionalIterator. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

Customization point objects

   The name ranges::advance denotes a customization point object, which is
   a function object of a literal Semiregular class type (denoted, for
   exposition purposes, as AdvanceT). All instances of AdvanceT are equal.
   Thus, ranges::advance can be copied freely and its copies can be used
   interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the
   requirements for arguments to ranges::advance above, AdvanceT will
   satisfy ranges::Invocable<const AdvanceT, Args...>. Otherwise, no
   function call operator of AdvanceT participates in overload resolution.

   In every translation unit in which ranges::advance is defined, it
   refers to the same instance of the customization point object. (This
   means that it can be used freely in things like inline functions and
   function templates without violating the one-definition rule.)

Return value

   1,2) (none)
   3) The number of increment/decrements not performed due to reaching
   bound. In other words, n - M, where M is the distance from the starting
   position of i to the ending position and is negative if the ending
   position is before the starting position.
