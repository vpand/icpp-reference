   class bad_optional_access;
                                            (library fundamentals TS)

   Defines a type of object to be thrown by
   std::experimental::optional::value when accessing an optional object
   that does not contain a value.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new bad_optional_access object
   (public member function)
   operator=
   replaces the bad_optional_access object
   (public member function)
   what
   returns the explanatory string
   (public member function)

std::experimental::bad_optional_access::bad_optional_access

   bad_optional_access() noexcept;
   (1) (library fundamentals TS)
   bad_optional_access( const bad_optional_access& other ) noexcept;
   (2) (library fundamentals TS)

   Constructs a new bad_optional_access object with an
   implementation-defined null-terminated byte string which is accessible
   through what().
   1) Default constructor.
   2) Copy constructor. If *this and other both have dynamic type
   std::experimental::bad_optional_access then std::strcmp(what(),
   other.what()) == 0.

Parameters

   other - another exception object to copy

std::experimental::bad_optional_access::operator=

   bad_optional_access& operator=( const bad_optional_access& other )
   noexcept;
   (library fundamentals TS)

   Assigns the contents with those of other. If *this and other both have
   dynamic type std::experimental::bad_optional_access then
   std::strcmp(what(), other.what()) == 0 after assignment.

Parameters

   other - another exception object to assign with

Return value

   *this

std::experimental::bad_optional_access::what

   virtual const char* what() const noexcept;
                                             (library fundamentals TS)

   Returns the explanatory string.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   Pointer to a null-terminated string with explanatory information. The
   string is suitable for conversion and display as a std::wstring. The
   pointer is guaranteed to be valid at least until the exception object
   from which it is obtained is destroyed, or until a non-const member
   function (e.g. copy assignment operator) on the exception object is
   called.

Notes

   Implementations are allowed but not required to override what().

Inherited from std::logic_error

Inherited from std::exception

Member functions

   (destructor)
   [virtual]
   destroys the exception object
   (virtual public member function of std::exception)
   what
   [virtual]
   returns an explanatory string
   (virtual public member function of std::exception)
