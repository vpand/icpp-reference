   Defined in header <compare>

   }
                                       (since C++20)
   Call signature
   template< class T, class U >

       requires /* see below */
   constexpr std::partial_ordering
       partial_order( T&& t, U&& u ) noexcept(/* see below */);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of
   type std::partial_ordering.

   Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and
   decltype((u)) respectively, std::partial_order(t, u) is
   expression-equivalent to:
     * If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> is true:
          + std::partial_ordering(partial_order(t, u)), if it is a
            well-formed expression with overload resolution performed in a
            context that does not include a declaration of
            std::partial_order,
          + otherwise, std::partial_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t,
            u)), if it is well-formed,
          + otherwise, std::partial_ordering(std::weak_order(t, u)), if it
            is well-formed.
     * In all other cases, the expression is ill-formed, which can result
       in substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of
       a template instantiation.

Customization point objects

   The name std::partial_order denotes a customization point object, which
   is a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For
   exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted
   as __partial_order_fn.

   All instances of __partial_order_fn are equal. The effects of invoking
   different instances of type __partial_order_fn on the same arguments
   are equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the
   instance is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not
   (however, a volatile-qualified instance is not required to be
   invocable). Thus, std::partial_order can be copied freely and its
   copies can be used interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the
   requirements for arguments to std::partial_order above,
   __partial_order_fn models
     * std::invocable<__partial_order_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<const __partial_order_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<__partial_order_fn&, Args...>, and
     * std::invocable<const __partial_order_fn&, Args...>.

   Otherwise, no function call operator of __partial_order_fn participates
   in overload resolution.
