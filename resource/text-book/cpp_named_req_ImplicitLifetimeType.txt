   Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name.
   This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included
   here as a named requirement only for consistency.

Requirements

   The following types are collectively called implicit-lifetime types:
     * scalar types
     * implicit-lifetime class types
     * array types
     * cv-qualified versions of these types

Notes

   Certain operations may implicitly create and start the lifetime of
   objects of implicit-lifetime types, if doing so would prevent undefined
   behavior. However, such operations do not start the lifetimes of
   subobjects of such objects that are not themselves of implicit-lifetime
   types.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   CWG 2489 C++20 an operation that begins the lifetime of a char array
   implicitly creates objects it does not
