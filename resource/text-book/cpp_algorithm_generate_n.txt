  Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class OutputIt, class Size, class Generator >
   OutputIt generate_n( OutputIt first, Size count, Generator g );
  (1)                                                    (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy,

             class ForwardIt, class Size, class Generator >
   ForwardIt generate_n( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                         ForwardIt first, Size count, Generator g );
  (2)                                                    (since C++17)
   1) Assigns values, generated by given function object g, to the first
   count elements in the range beginning at first, if count > 0. Does
   nothing otherwise.
   2) Same as (1), but executed according to policy.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

   If Size is not convertible to an integral type, the program is
   ill-formed.

Parameters

   first - the beginning of the range of elements to generate
   count - number of the elements to generate
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   g - generator function object that will be called.

   The signature of the function should be equivalent to the following:
   Ret fun();

   The type Ret must be such that an object of type OutputIt can be
   dereferenced and assigned a value of type Ret.
   Type requirements
   -
   OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

Return value

   Iterator one past the last element assigned if count > 0, first
   otherwise.

Complexity

   Exactly std::max(0, count) invocations of g() and assignments.

Exceptions

   The overload with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy reports
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Possible implementation

template<class OutputIt, class Size, class Generator>
constexpr // since C++20
OutputIt generate_n(OutputIt first, Size count, Generator g)
{
    for (Size i = 0; i < count; ++i, ++first)
        *first = g();

    return first;
}

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <random>

int main()
{
    std::mt19937 rng; // default constructed, seeded with fixed seed
    std::generate_n(std::ostream_iterator<std::mt19937::result_type>(std::cout,
" "),
                    5, std::ref(rng));
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Output:
3499211612 581869302 3890346734 3586334585 545404204

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 426 C++98 the complexity requirement was "exactly count invocations
   or assignments", which is broken if count is negative no invocation or
   assignment
   if count is non-positive
   LWG 865 C++98 the location of the first element following
   the generation range was not returned returned
