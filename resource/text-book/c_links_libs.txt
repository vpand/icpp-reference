A list of open source C libraries

   From cppreference.com
   < c | links

   The objective of this page is to build a comprehensive list of
   open-source C libraries, so that when one needs an implementation of
   particular functionality, one needn't to waste time searching on web
   (DuckDuckGo, Google, Bing, etc.)

   If you know a library that might be useful to others, please add a link
   to it here. There are no restrictions on what can be included except
   that the source of the library must be readily available to download.

   The page is provided "as is" - with the hope of being useful, but
   without any warranties. Outdated, misleading or wrong links might
   appear here. If you've noticed one of these, it would be great if you
   fixed the error.
