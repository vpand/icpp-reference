   Defined in header <threads.h>
   int mtx_init( mtx_t* mutex, int type );
                                          (since C11)

   Creates a new mutex object with type. The object pointed to by mutex is
   set to an identifier of the newly created mutex.

   type must have one of the following values:
     * mtx_plain - a simple, non-recursive mutex is created.
     * mtx_timed - a non-recursive mutex, that supports timeout, is
       created.
     * mtx_plain | mtx_recursive - a recursive mutex is created.
     * mtx_timed | mtx_recursive - a recursive mutex, that supports
       timeout, is created.

Parameters

   mutex - pointer to the mutex to initialize
   type  - the type of the mutex

Return value

   thrd_success if successful, thrd_error otherwise.
