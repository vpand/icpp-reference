   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/iterator>
   template< class I >

   concept bool ForwardIterator =
       InputIterator<I> &&
       DerivedFrom<ranges::iterator_category_t<I>,
   ranges::forward_iterator_tag> &&
       Incrementable<I> &&
       Sentinel<I, I>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept ForwardIterator<I> refines InputIterator by adding equality
   comparison and the multi-pass guarantee.

   The domain of == for forward iterators is that of iterators over the
   same underlying sequence, except that value-initialized iterators of
   the same type may be compared with each other and shall compare equal.

   Pointers and references obtained from a forward iterator into a range
   [i, s) must remain valid while [i, s) continues to denote a range.

   Let a and b be two dereferenceable iterators of type I.
   ForwardIterator<I> is satisfied only if:
     * a == b implies ++a == ++b; and
     * The expression ([](X x){ ++x; }(a), *a) is equivalent to *a, i.e.,
       incrementing a copy of a has no effect on the result of
       dereferencing a.

   This is known as the multi-pass guarantee.

Notes

   A forward iterator cannot be "stashing": it cannot return a reference
   to an object within itself, because such references would be
   invalidated by the destruction of the forward iterator.
