   Defined in header <ios>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
   > class basic_ios
       : public std::ios_base

   The class std::basic_ios provides facilities for interfacing with
   objects that have std::basic_streambuf interface. Several
   std::basic_ios objects can refer to one actual std::basic_streambuf
   object.

   (typedef)

Notes

   Straightforward implementation of std::basic_ios stores only the
   following members (which all depend on the template parameters and thus
   cannot be part of std::ios_base):
     * the fill character (see fill())
     * the tied stream pointer (see tie())
     * the associated stream buffer pointer (see rdbuf()).

   Actual implementations vary:

   Microsoft Visual Studio stores just those three members.

   LLVM libc++ stores 1 less member: it maintains the rdbuf pointer as a
   void* member of ios_base.

   GNU libstdc++ stores 4 additional members: three cached facets and a
   flag to indicate that fill was initialized.
