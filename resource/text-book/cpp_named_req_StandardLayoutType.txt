   Specifies that a type is a standard layout type. Standard layout types
   are useful for communicating with code written in other programming
   languages.

   Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name.
   This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included
   here as a named requirement only for consistency.

Requirements

   The following types are collectively called standard-layout types:
     * scalar types
     * standard-layout class types
     * arrays of such types
     * cv-qualified versions of these types

Properties

   See Standard-layout.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   CWG 1672 C++11 first non-static data member rule ignored
   existence of empty base classes first non-static data member rule
   made recursive
   CWG 1813 C++11 class with a member defined in an indirect base
   wasn't technically standard-layout all member declarations must be
   in the same class
   CWG 2120 C++11 array as first member wasn't considered when
   comparing the first element type with type of a base array members are
   considered
