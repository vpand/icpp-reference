   Defined in header <stdlib.h>
   _Noreturn void quick_exit( int exit_code );
   (since C11)
   (until C23)
   [[noreturn]] void quick_exit( int exit_code );
                                                 (since C23)

   Causes normal program termination to occur without completely cleaning
   the resources.

   Functions passed to at_quick_exit are called in reverse order of their
   registration. After calling the registered functions, calls
   _Exit(exit_code).

   Functions passed to atexit or signal handlers passed to signal are not
   called.

Parameters

   exit_code - exit status of the program

Return value

   (none)

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void f1(void)
{
    puts("pushed first");
    fflush(stdout);
}

void f2(void)
{
    puts("pushed second");
}

void f3(void)
{
    puts("won't be called");
}

int main(void)
{
    at_quick_exit(f1);
    at_quick_exit(f2);
    atexit(f3);
    quick_exit(0);
}

   Output:
pushed second
pushed first
