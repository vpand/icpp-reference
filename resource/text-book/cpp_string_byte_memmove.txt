   Defined in header <cstring>
   void* memmove( void* dest, const void* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count characters from the object pointed to by src to the object
   pointed to by dest. Both objects are reinterpreted as arrays of
   unsigned char.

   The objects may overlap: copying takes place as if the characters were
   copied to a temporary character array and then the characters were
   copied from the array to dest.

   If either dest or src is an invalid or null pointer, the behavior is
   undefined, even if count is zero.

   If the objects are potentially-overlapping or not TriviallyCopyable,
   the behavior of memmove is not specified and may be undefined.

Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the memory location to copy to
   src   - pointer to the memory location to copy from
   count - number of bytes to copy

Return value

   dest

Notes

   std::memmove may be used to implicitly create objects in the
   destination buffer.

   Despite being specified "as if" a temporary buffer is used, actual
   implementations of this function do not incur the overhead of double
   copying or extra memory. For small count, it may load up and write out
   registers; for larger blocks, a common approach (glibc and bsd libc) is
   to copy bytes forwards from the beginning of the buffer if the
   destination starts before the source, and backwards from the end
   otherwise, with a fall back to std::memcpy when there is no overlap at
   all.

   Where strict aliasing prohibits examining the same memory as values of
   two different types, std::memmove may be used to convert the values.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char str[] = "1234567890";
    std::cout << str << '\n';
    std::memmove(str + 4, str + 3, 3); // copies from [4, 5, 6] to [5, 6, 7]
    std::cout << str << '\n';
}

   Output:
1234567890
1234456890
