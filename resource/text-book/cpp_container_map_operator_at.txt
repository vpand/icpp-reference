   T& operator[]( const Key& key );
   (1)
   T& operator[]( Key&& key );
   (2)                             (since C++11)
   template< class K >
   T& operator[]( K&& x );
   (3)                             (since C++26)

   Returns a reference to the value that is mapped to a key equivalent to
   key or x respectively, performing an insertion if such key does not
   already exist.
   1) Inserts value_type(key, T()) if the key does not exist.
   -
   key_type must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible.
   -
   mapped_type must meet the requirements of CopyConstructible and
   DefaultConstructible.
   If an insertion is performed, the mapped value is value-initialized
   (default-constructed for class types, zero-initialized otherwise) and a
   reference to it is returned.
   (until C++11)
   1) Inserts a value_type object constructed in-place from
   std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(key), std::tuple<>() if
   the key does not exist.
   Equivalent to return this->try_emplace(key).first->second;.(since
   C++17)When the default allocator is used, this results in the key being
   copy constructed from key and the mapped value being value-initialized.
   -
   value_type must be EmplaceConstructible from std::piecewise_construct,
   std::forward_as_tuple(key), std::tuple<>(). When the default allocator
   is used, this means that key_type must be CopyConstructible and
   mapped_type must be DefaultConstructible.
   2) Inserts a value_type object constructed in-place from
   std::piecewise_construct, std::forward_as_tuple(std::move(key)),
   std::tuple<>() if the key does not exist.
   Equivalent to return
   this->try_emplace(std::move(key)).first->second;.(since C++17)
   When the default allocator is used, this results in the key being move
   constructed from key and the mapped value being value-initialized.
   -
   value_type must be EmplaceConstructible from std::piecewise_construct,
   std::forward_as_tuple(std::move(key)), std::tuple<>(). When the default
   allocator is used, this means that key_type must be MoveConstructible
   and mapped_type must be DefaultConstructible.
   (since C++11)
   3) Inserts a value_type object constructed in-place if there is no key
   that transparently compares equivalent to the value x.
   Equivalent to return
   this->try_emplace(std::forward<K>(x)).first->second;. This overload
   participates in overload resolution only if the qualified-id
   Compare::is_transparent is valid and denotes a type. It allows calling
   this function without constructing an instance of Key.

   No iterators or references are invalidated.

Parameters

   key - the key of the element to find
   x   - a value of any type that can be transparently compared with a key

Return value

   1,2) A reference to the mapped value of the new element if no element
   with key key existed. Otherwise, a reference to the mapped value of the
   existing element whose key is equivalent to key.
   3) A reference to the mapped value of the new element if no element
   with key that compares equivalent to the value x existed. Otherwise, a
   reference to the mapped value of the existing element whose key
   compares equivalent to x.

Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown by any operation, the insertion has no
   effect.

Complexity

   Logarithmic in the size of the container.

Notes

   In the published C++11 and C++14 standards, this function was specified
   to require mapped_type to be DefaultInsertable and key_type to be
   CopyInsertable or MoveInsertable into *this. This specification was
   defective and was fixed by LWG issue 2469, and the description above
   incorporates the resolution of that issue.

   However, one implementation (libc++) is known to construct the key_type
   and mapped_type objects via two separate allocator construct() calls,
   as arguably required by the standards as published, rather than
   emplacing a value_type object.

   operator[] is non-const because it inserts the key if it doesn't exist.
   If this behavior is undesirable or if the container is const, at may be
   used.

   insert_or_assign returns more information than operator[] and does not
   require default-constructibility of the mapped type.

   __cpp_lib_associative_heterogeneous_insertion 202311L (C++26)
   Heterogeneous overloads for the remaining member functions in ordered
   and unordered associative containers. (3)

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>

void println(auto const comment, auto const& map)
{
    std::cout << comment << '{';
    for (const auto& pair : map)
        std::cout << '{' << pair.first << ": " << pair.second << '}';
    std::cout << "}\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::map<char, int> letter_counts{{'a', 27}, {'b', 3}, {'c', 1}};

    println("letter_counts initially contains: ", letter_counts);

    letter_counts['b'] = 42; // updates an existing value
    letter_counts['x'] = 9;  // inserts a new value

    println("after modifications it contains: ", letter_counts);

    // count the number of occurrences of each word
    // (the first call to operator[] initialized the counter with zero)
    std::map<std::string, int>  word_map;
    for (const auto& w : {"this", "sentence", "is", "not", "a", "sentence",
                          "this", "sentence", "is", "a", "hoax"})
        ++word_map[w];
    word_map["that"]; // just inserts the pair {"that", 0}

    for (const auto& [word, count] : word_map)
        std::cout << count << " occurrence(s) of word '" << word << "'\n";
}

   Output:
letter_counts initially contains: {{a: 27}{b: 3}{c: 1}}
after modifications it contains: {{a: 27}{b: 42}{c: 1}{x: 9}}
2 occurrence(s) of word 'a'
1 occurrence(s) of word 'hoax'
2 occurrence(s) of word 'is'
1 occurrence(s) of word 'not'
3 occurrence(s) of word 'sentence'
0 occurrence(s) of word 'that'
2 occurrence(s) of word 'this'

Defect reports

   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
