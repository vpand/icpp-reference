   Specifies that an object of the type can be constructed from a given
   set of arguments in uninitialized storage by a given allocator.

Requirements

   The type T is EmplaceConstructible into the Container X (whose
   value_type is identical to T) from the arguments args if, given
   A    an allocator type
   m    an lvalue of type A
   p    the pointer of type T* prepared by the container
   args zero or more arguments

   where X::allocator_type is identical to
   std::allocator_traits<A>::rebind_alloc<T>,

   the following expression is well-formed:
std::allocator_traits<A>::construct(m, p, args);

   If X is not allocator-aware or is a std::basic_string specialization,
   the term is defined as if A were std::allocator<T>, except that no
   allocator object needs to be created, and user-defined specializations
   of std::allocator are not instantiated.

Notes

   Although it is required that customized construct is used when
   constructing elements of std::basic_string until C++23, all
   implementations only used the default mechanism. The requirement is
   corrected by P1072R10 to match existing practice.
