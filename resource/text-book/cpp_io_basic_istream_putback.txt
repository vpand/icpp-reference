   basic_istream& putback( char_type ch );

   Puts the character ch back to the input stream so the next extracted
   character will be ch.

   First clears eofbit, then behaves as UnformattedInputFunction. After
   constructing and checking the sentry object, if rdbuf() is not null,
   calls rdbuf()->sputbackc(ch), which calls rdbuf()->pbackfail(ch) if ch
   does not equal the most recently extracted character.

   If rdbuf() is null or if rdbuf->sputbackc(ch) returns Traits::eof(),
   calls setstate(badbit).

   In any case, sets the gcount() counter to zero.

Parameters

   ch - character to put into input stream

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and
   exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit
   is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

Example

   Demonstrates the difference between modifying and non-modifying
   putback().
   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::stringstream s1("Hello, world"); // IO stream
    s1.get();
    if (s1.putback('Y')) // modifies the buffer
        std::cout << s1.rdbuf() << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << "putback failed\n";

    std::cout << "--\n";

    std::istringstream s2("Hello, world"); // input-only stream
    s2.get();
    if (s2.putback('Y')) // cannot modify input-only buffer
        std::cout << s2.rdbuf() << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << "putback failed\n";
    s2.clear();

    std::cout << "--\n";

    if (s2.putback('H')) // non-modifying putback
        std::cout << s2.rdbuf() << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << "putback failed\n";
}

   Output:
Yello, world
--
putback failed
--
Hello, world
