   Defined in header <uchar.h>
   size_t mbrtoc8( char8_t * restrict pc8, const char * restrict s,
                   size_t n, mbstate_t * restrict ps );
                                                                   (since C23)

   Converts a narrow multibyte character to UTF-8 encoding.

   If s is not a null pointer, inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte
   character string, beginning with the byte pointed to by s to determine
   the number of bytes necessary to complete the next multibyte character
   (including any shift sequences). If the function determines that the
   next multibyte character in s is complete and valid, converts it to
   UTF-8 and stores the first UTF-8 code unit in *pc8 (if pc8 is not
   null).

   If UTF-8 encoding of the multibyte character in *s consists of more
   than one UTF-8 code unit, then after the first call to this function,
   *ps is updated in such a way that the next call to mbrtoc8 will write
   out the additional UTF-8 code units, without considering *s.

   If s is a null pointer, the values of n and pc8 are ignored and the
   call is equivalent to mbrtoc8(nullptr, "", 1, ps).

   If UTF-8 code unit produced is u8'\0', the conversion state *ps
   represents the initial shift state.

   The multibyte encoding used by this function is specified by the
   currently active C locale.

Parameters

   pc8 - pointer to the location where the resulting UTF-8 code units will
   be written
   s - pointer to the multibyte character string used as input
   n - limit on the number of bytes in s that can be examined
   ps - pointer to the conversion state object used when interpreting the
   multibyte string

Return value

   The first of the following that applies:
     * 0 if the character converted from s (and stored in *pc8 if
       non-null) was the null character
     * the number of bytes [1...n] of the multibyte character successfully
       converted from s
     * (size_t)-3 if the next UTF-8 code unit from a character whose
       encoding consists of multiple code units has now been written to
       *pc8. No bytes are processed from the input in this case.
     * (size_t)-2 if the next n bytes constitute an incomplete, but so far
       valid, multibyte character. Nothing is written to *pc8.
     * (size_t)-1 if encoding error occurs. Nothing is written to *pc8,
       the value EILSEQ is stored in errno and the value of *ps is
       unspecified.
