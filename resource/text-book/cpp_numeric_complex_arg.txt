   Defined in header <complex>
                                     (A)
   float       arg( float f );

   template< class FloatingPoint >

   FloatingPoint
               arg( FloatingPoint f );
                                         (since C++23)
   template< class Integer >
   double      arg( Integer i );
   (B)
   1) Calculates the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number z.
   A,B) Additional overloads are provided for all integer and
   floating-point types, which are treated as complex numbers with zero
   imaginary component.
   (since C++11)

Parameters

   z - complex value
   f - floating-point value
   i - integer value

Return value

   1) std::atan2(std::imag(z), std::real(z)). If no errors occur, this is
   the phase angle of z in the interval [-p; p].
   A) Zero if f is positive or +0, p if f is negative or -0, NaN
   otherwise.
   B) Zero if i is non-negative, p if it is negative.

Notes

   The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as
   (A,B). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their
   argument num:
     * If num has a standard(until C++23) floating-point type T, then
       std::arg(num) has the same effect as
       std::arg(std::complex<T>(num)).
     * Otherwise, if num has an integer type, then std::arg(num) has the
       same effect as std::arg(std::complex<double>(num)).

Example

   Run this code
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::complex<double> z1(1, 0);
    std::complex<double> z2(0, 0);
    std::complex<double> z3(0, 1);
    std::complex<double> z4(-1, 0);
    std::complex<double> z5(-1, -0.0);
    double f = 1.;
    int i = -1;

    std::cout << "phase angle of " << z1 << " is " << std::arg(z1) << '\n'
              << "phase angle of " << z2 << " is " << std::arg(z2) << '\n'
              << "phase angle of " << z3 << " is " << std::arg(z3) << '\n'
              << "phase angle of " << z4 << " is " << std::arg(z4) << '\n'
              << "phase angle of " << z5 << " is " << std::arg(z5) << " "
                 "(the other side of the cut)\n"
              << "phase angle of " << f << " is " << std::arg(f) << '\n'
              << "phase angle of " << i << " is " << std::arg(i) << '\n';

}

   Output:
phase angle of (1,0) is 0
phase angle of (0,0) is 0
phase angle of (0,1) is 1.5708
phase angle of (-1,0) is 3.14159
phase angle of (-1,-0) is -3.14159 (the other side of the cut)
phase angle of 1 is 0
phase angle of -1 is 3.14159
