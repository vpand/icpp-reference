   protected:
   int sync() override;

   First, records that a flush is pending, by updating the appropriate
   private flag.

   Then, if the current emit-on-sync policy is true, makes a call to
   emit().

   Otherwise (if the emit-on-sync policy is false, which is the default),
   the flush is suspended until emit() is called, such as through
   std::basic_osyncstream::emit() or
   std::basic_osyncstream::~basic_osyncstream

Parameters

   (none)

Notes

   sync() or its equivalent is implicitly called by close(), seekoff(),
   and seekpos() and explicitly called by std::basic_streambuf::pubsync()
