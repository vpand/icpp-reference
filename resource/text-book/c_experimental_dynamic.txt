   Extensions to the C Library Part II: Dynamic Allocation Functions,
   ISO/IEC TR 24731-2:2010, defines the following new components for the C
   standard library:
   __STDC_ALLOC_LIB__
   integer constant of type long indicating conformance level
   (macro constant)
   Defined in header <stdio.h>
   fmemopen
   (dynamic memory TR)
   opens a fixed-size memory buffer as an I/O stream
   (function)
   open_memstreamopen_wmemstream
   (dynamic memory TR)
   opens a dynamically resized memory buffer as an I/O stream
   (function)
   asprintfaswprintfvasprintfvaswprintf
   (dynamic memory TR)
   variants of sprintf etc that write to automatically-allocated buffer
   and return a pointer to it
   (function)
   getlinegetwlinegetdelimgetwdelim
   (dynamic memory TR)
   read from a stream into an automatically resized buffer until
   delimiter/end of line
   (function)
   Defined in header <string.h>
   strdup
   (dynamic memory TR)
   allocate a copy of a string
   (function)
   strndup
   (dynamic memory TR)
   allocate a copy of a string up to specified size
   (function)

   This library extension also introduces assignment-allocation character
   m for use with %s, %[, and %c conversion specifiers in fscanf and
   fwscanf family of functions.

Notes

   The functions fmemopen, open_memstream, open_wmemstream, getdelim,
   getline, strdup, strndup, and the extensions to fscanf are available in
   POSIX (ISO/IEC 9945:2003).

   The functions asprintf and vasprintf are available in Linux Standard
   Base (ISO/IEC IS 23360:2006)
