   friend constexpr void swap( tagged& lhs, tagged& rhs )
   noexcept(noexcept(lhs.swap(rhs)))
       requires Swappable<Base>;

   Swap the contents of *this and rhs, as if by lhs.swap(rhs);.

   This function is not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified
   lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when tagged
   is an associated class of the arguments.

Notes

   Unlike most non-member swaps in the standard library, this swap is a
   hidden friend function declared in the body of tagged, not a function
   template. The tagged in the function declaration is the
   injected-class-name.
