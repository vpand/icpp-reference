   basic_istream& ignore( std::streamsize count = 1, int_type delim =
   Traits::eof() );

   Extracts and discards characters from the input stream until and
   including delim.

   ignore behaves as an UnformattedInputFunction. After constructing and
   checking the sentry object, it extracts characters from the stream and
   discards them until any of the following conditions occurs:
     * count characters were extracted. This test is disabled in the
       special case when count equals
       std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max().

     * end of file conditions occurs in the input sequence, in which case
       the function calls setstate(eofbit).

     * the next available character c in the input sequence is delim, as
       determined by Traits::eq_int_type(Traits::to_int_type(c), delim).
       The delimiter character is extracted and discarded. This test is
       disabled if delim is Traits::eof().

Parameters

   count - number of characters to extract
   delim - delimiting character to stop the extraction at. It is also
   extracted

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and
   exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit
   is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

Example

   The following example uses ignore to skip over non-numeric input:
   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <limits>
#include <sstream>

constexpr auto max_size = std::numeric_limits<std::streamsize>::max();

int main()
{
    std::istringstream input("1\n"
                             "some non-numeric input\n"
                             "2\n");
    for (;;)
    {
        int n;
        input >> n;

        if (input.eof() || input.bad())
            break;
        else if (input.fail())
        {
            input.clear(); // unset failbit
            input.ignore(max_size, '\n'); // skip bad input
        }
        else
            std::cout << n << '\n';
    }
}

   Output:
1
2

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 172 C++98 the type of count was misspecified as int corrected to
   std::streamsize
