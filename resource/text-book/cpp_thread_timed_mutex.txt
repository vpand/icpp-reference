   Defined in header <mutex>
   class timed_mutex;
                            (since C++11)

   The timed_mutex class is a synchronization primitive that can be used
   to protect shared data from being simultaneously accessed by multiple
   threads.

   In a manner similar to mutex, timed_mutex offers exclusive,
   non-recursive ownership semantics. In addition, timed_mutex provides
   the ability to attempt to claim ownership of a timed_mutex with a
   timeout via the member functions try_lock_for() and try_lock_until().

   The timed_mutex class satisfies all requirements of TimedMutex and
   StandardLayoutType.

Member types

Locking

   lock
   locks the mutex, blocks if the mutex is not available
   (public member function)
   try_lock
   tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex is not available
   (public member function)
   try_lock_for
   tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex has been
   unavailable for the specified timeout duration
   (public member function)
   try_lock_until
   tries to lock the mutex, returns if the mutex has been
   unavailable until specified time point has been reached
   (public member function)
   unlock
