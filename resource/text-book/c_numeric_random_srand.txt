   Pseudo-random number generation
   rand
   srand
   RAND_MAX

   Defined in header <stdlib.h>
   void srand( unsigned seed );

   Seeds the pseudo-random number generator used by rand() with the value
   seed.

   If rand() is used before any calls to srand(), rand() behaves as if it
   was seeded with srand(1).

   Each time rand() is seeded with the same seed, it must produce the same
   sequence of values.

   srand() is not guaranteed to be thread-safe.

Parameters

   seed - the seed value

Return value

   (none)

Notes

   Generally speaking, the pseudo-random number generator should only be
   seeded once, before any calls to rand(), and the start of the program.
   It should not be repeatedly seeded, or reseeded every time you wish to
   generate a new batch of pseudo-random numbers.

   Standard practice is to use the result of a call to time(0) as the
   seed. However, time() returns a time_t value, and time_t is not
   guaranteed to be an integral type. In practice, though, every major
   implementation defines time_t to be an integral type, and this is also
   what POSIX requires.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void)
{
    srand(time(NULL)); //use current time as seed for random generator
    int random_variable = rand();
    printf("Random value on [0,%d]: %d\n", RAND_MAX, random_variable);
}

   Possible output:
Random value on [0 2147483647]: 1373858591
