   Defined in header <cstdio>
   char* gets( char* str );
   (deprecated in C++11)
   (removed in C++14)

   Reads stdin into given character string until a newline character is
   found or end-of-file occurs.

Parameters

   str - character string to be written

Return value

   str on success, a null pointer on failure.

   If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally
   sets the eof indicator (see std::feof()) on stdin. If the failure has
   been caused by some other error, sets the error indicator (see
   std::ferror()) on stdin.

Notes

   The std::gets() function does not perform bounds checking. Therefore,
   this function is extremely vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks. It
   cannot be used safely (unless the program runs in an environment which
   restricts what can appear on stdin). For this reason, the function was
   deprecated in C++11 and removed altogether in C++14. std::fgets() may
   be used instead.

Example

   Run this code
#include <array>
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main()
{
    std::puts("Never use std::gets(). Use std::fgets() instead!");

    std::array<char, 16> buf;

    std::printf("Enter a string:\n>");

    if (std::fgets(buf.data(), buf.size(), stdin))
    {
        const auto len = std::strlen(buf.data());
        std::printf(
            "The input string:\n[%s] is %s and has the length %li characters.\n"
,
            buf.data(), len + 1 < buf.size() ? "not truncated" : "truncated", le
n
        );
    }
    else if (std::feof(stdin))
    {
        std::puts("Error: the end of stdin stream has been reached.");
    }
    else if (std::ferror(stdin))
    {
        std::puts("I/O error when reading from stdin.");
    }
    else
    {
        std::puts("Unknown stdin error.");
    }
}

   Possible output:
Never use std::gets(). Use std::fgets() instead!
Enter a string:
>Living on Earth is expensive, but it does include a free trip around the Sun.
The input string:
[Living on Earth] is truncated and has the length 15 characters.
