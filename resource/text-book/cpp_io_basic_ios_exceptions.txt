   std::ios_base::iostate exceptions() const;
   (1)
   void exceptions( std::ios_base::iostate except );
   (2)

   Gets and sets the exception mask of the stream. The exception mask
   determines which error states trigger exceptions of type failure.
   1) Returns the exception mask.
   2) Sets the exception mask to except. If the stream has an error state
   covered by the exception mask when called, an exception is immediately
   triggered.

Parameters

   except - exception mask

Return value

   1) The current exception mask.
   2) (none)

Notes

   This section is incomplete
   Reason: discuss LWG2349 and link from ios_base::clear, and from
   (un)formatted(i/o)utputfunction requirement pages (or perhaps the
   behavior should be fully elaborated on the requirement pages and linked
   from here). See also stackoverflow.com/a/35089910

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int ivalue;
    try
    {
        std::ifstream in("in.txt");
        in.exceptions(std::ifstream::failbit); // may throw
        in >> ivalue; // may throw
    }
    catch (const std::ios_base::failure& fail)
    {
        // handle exception here
        std::cout << fail.what() << '\n';
    }
}

   Possible output:
basic_ios::clear: iostream error
