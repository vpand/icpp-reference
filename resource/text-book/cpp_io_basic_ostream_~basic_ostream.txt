   virtual ~basic_ostream();

   Destroys the basic_ostream object. This destructor does not perform any
   operation on the underlying streambuffer (rdbuf()): the destructors of
   the derived output streams such as std::basic_ofstream and
   std::basic_ostringstream are responsible for calling the destructors of
   the stream buffers.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

void add_words(std::streambuf* p)
{
    std::ostream buf(p); // buf shares the buffer with s
    buf << " is the answer";
} // calls the destructor of buf. p remains unaffected

int main()
{
    std::ostringstream s;
    s << 42;
    add_words(s.rdbuf());
    s << ".";
    std::cout << s.str() << '\n';
}

   Output:
42 is the answer.
