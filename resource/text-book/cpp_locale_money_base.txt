   Defined in header <locale>
   class money_base;

   The class std::money_base provides constants which are inherited and
   used by the std::moneypunct, std::money_get and std::money_put facets.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   enum part { none, space, symbol, sign, value }; unscoped enumeration
   type
   struct pattern { char field[4]; }; the monetary format type
   Enumeration constant Definition
   none whitespace is permitted but not required except in the last
   position, where whitespace is not permitted
   space one or more whitespace characters are required
   symbol the sequence of characters returned by moneypunct::curr_symbol
   is required
   sign the first of the characters returned by moneypunct::positive_sign
   or moneypunct::negative_sign is required
   value the absolute numeric monetary value is required

Notes

   The monetary format is an array of four chars convertible to
   std::money_base::part. In that sequence, each of symbol, sign, and
   value appears exactly once, and either space or none appears in the
   remaining position. The value none, if present, is not first; the value
   space, if present, is neither first nor last.

   The default format, returned by the standard specializations of
   std::moneypunct is {symbol, sign, none, value}.
