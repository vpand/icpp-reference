   Defined in header <stdatomic.h>
   void atomic_signal_fence( memory_order order );
                                                  (since C11)

   Establishes memory synchronization ordering of non-atomic and relaxed
   atomic accesses, as instructed by order, between a thread and a signal
   handler executed on the same thread. This is equivalent to
   atomic_thread_fence, except no CPU instructions for memory ordering are
   issued. Only reordering of the instructions by the compiler is
   suppressed as order instructs. For example, a fence with release
   semantics prevents reads or writes from being moved past subsequent
   writes and a fence with acquire semantics prevents reads or writes from
   being moved ahead of preceding reads.

Parameters

   order - the memory ordering executed by this fence

Return value

   (none)
