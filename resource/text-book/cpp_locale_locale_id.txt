   Defined in header <locale>
   class locale::id;

   The class std::locale::id provides implementation-specific
   identification of a locale facet. Each facet has a public static member
   named id of type std::locale::id and each std::locale object maintains
   a list of facets it implements, indexed by their ids.

   Facets with the same id belong to the same facet category and replace
   each other when added to a locale object.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new id
   (public member function)
   operator=
   copy assignment operator is deleted
   (public member function)

Example

   The following example shows how to construct a minimal custom facet.
   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

struct myfacet : std::locale::facet
{
    myfacet(std::size_t refs = 0) : facet(refs) {}
    static ::std::locale::id id;
};

std::locale::id myfacet::id;

int main()
{
    std::locale myloc(std::locale(), new myfacet);
    std::cout << "has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) returns " << std::boolalpha
              << std::has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) << '\n';
}

   Output:
has_facet<myfacet>(myloc) returns true
