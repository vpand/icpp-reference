       operator<=>( const std::map<Key, T, Compare, Alloc>& lhs,

   (7)                                                       (since C++20)

   Compares the contents of two maps.
   1,2) Checks if the contents of lhs and rhs are equal, that is, they
   have the same number of elements and each element in lhs compares equal
   with the element in rhs at the same position.
   3-6) Compares the contents of lhs and rhs lexicographically. The
   comparison is performed by a function equivalent to
   std::lexicographical_compare. This comparison ignores the map's
   ordering Compare.
   7) Compares the contents of lhs and rhs lexicographically. The
   comparison is performed as if by calling
   std::lexicographical_compare_three_way(lhs.begin(), lhs.end(),
                                          rhs.begin(),
   rhs.end(), synth-three-way).This comparison ignores the map's ordering
   Compare.
   The return type is the return type of synth-three-way (i.e.,
   synth-three-way-result¿<T>).
   If none of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * T models three_way_comparable.
     * < is defined for values of type (possibly const-qualified) T, and <
       is a total ordering relationship.

   The <, <=, >, >=, and != operators are synthesized from operator<=> and
   operator== respectively.
   (since C++20)

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - maps whose contents to compare
   -
   T, Key must meet the requirements of EqualityComparable in order to use
   overloads (1,2).
   -
   Key must meet the requirements of LessThanComparable in order to use
   overloads (3-6). The ordering relation must establish total order.

Return value

   1) true if the contents of the maps are equal, false otherwise.
   2) true if the contents of the maps are not equal, false otherwise.
   3) true if the contents of the lhs are lexicographically less than the
   contents of rhs, false otherwise.
   4) true if the contents of the lhs are lexicographically less than or
   equal to the contents of rhs, false otherwise.
   5) true if the contents of the lhs are lexicographically greater than
   the contents of rhs, false otherwise.
   6) true if the contents of the lhs are lexicographically greater than
   or equal to the contents of rhs, false otherwise.
   7) The relative order of the first pair of non-equivalent elements in
   lhs and rhs if there are such elements, lhs.size() <=> rhs.size()
   otherwise.

Complexity

   1,2) Constant if lhs and rhs are of different size, otherwise linear in
   the size of the map.
   3-7) Linear in the size of the map.

Notes

   The relational operators are defined in terms of the element type's
   operator<.
   (until C++20)

   The relational operators are defined in terms of synth-three-way, which
   uses operator<=> if possible, or operator< otherwise.

   Notably, if the element does not itself provide operator<=>, but is
   implicitly convertible to a three-way comparable type, that conversion
   will be used instead of operator<.
   (since C++20)

Example

   Run this code
#include <cassert>
#include <map>

int main()
{
    std::map<int, char> a{{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}, {3, 'c'}};
    std::map<int, char> b{{1, 'a'}, {2, 'b'}, {3, 'c'}};
    std::map<int, char> c{{7, 'Z'}, {8, 'Y'}, {9, 'X'}, {10, 'W'}};

    assert
    (""
        "Compare equal containers:" &&
        (a != b) == false &&
        (a == b) == true &&
        (a < b) == false &&
        (a <= b) == true &&
        (a > b) == false &&
        (a >= b) == true &&
        (a <=> b) != std::weak_ordering::less &&
        (a <=> b) != std::weak_ordering::greater &&
        (a <=> b) == std::weak_ordering::equivalent &&
        (a <=> b) >= 0 &&
        (a <=> b) <= 0 &&
        (a <=> b) == 0 &&

        "Compare non equal containers:" &&
        (a != c) == true &&
        (a == c) == false &&
        (a < c) == true &&
        (a <= c) == true &&
        (a > c) == false &&
        (a >= c) == false &&
        (a <=> c) == std::weak_ordering::less &&
        (a <=> c) != std::weak_ordering::equivalent &&
        (a <=> c) != std::weak_ordering::greater &&
        (a <=> c) < 0 &&
        (a <=> c) != 0 &&
        (a <=> c) <= 0 &&
    "");
