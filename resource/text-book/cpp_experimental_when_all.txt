   Defined in header <experimental/future>
   template< class InputIt >

   auto when_all( InputIt first, InputIt last )
       -> future<std::vector<typename
   std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::value_type>>;
   (1)                                    (concurrency TS)
   template< class... Futures >

   auto when_all( Futures&&... futures )
       -> future<std::tuple<std::decay_t<Futures>...>>;
   (2)                                    (concurrency TS)

   Create a future object that becomes ready when all of the input futures
   and shared_futures become ready. The behavior is undefined if any input
   future or shared_future is invalid.

   In particular, let Sequence be a std::vector<typename
   std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::value_type> for (1) and
   std::tuple<std::decay_t<Futures>...> for (2). This function template
   creates a shared state containing Sequence and returns a future
   referring to the shared state. Every input future is moved into the
   corresponding object in the Sequence in the shared state, and every
   input shared_future is copied to the corresponding object in the
   Sequence in the shared state. The order of the objects in the Sequence
   matches the order of arguments.
   1) This function does not participate in overload resolution unless
   InputIt's value type (i.e., typename
   std::iterator_traits<InputIt>::value_type) is a
   std::experimental::future or std::experimental::shared_future.
   2) This function does not participate in overload resolution unless
   every argument is either a (possibly cv-qualified)
   std::experimental::shared_future or a cv-unqualified
   std::experimental::future. (Formally, for every type Fn in Futures,
   either std::remove_reference_t<Fn> is std::experimental::future<Rn>, or
   std::decay_t<Fn> is std::experimental::shared_future<Rn>.)

   After this call, every input future is no longer valid; every input
   shared_future remains valid.

Return value

   A future referring to the shared state created by the call. The future
   is always valid(), and it becomes ready when all of the input futures
   and shared_futures the call are ready.
   1) If the range is empty (i.e., first == last), the returned future
   contains an empty vector and is ready immediately.
   2) If there are no arguments supplied, a future<std::tuple<>> is
   returned and is immediately ready.
