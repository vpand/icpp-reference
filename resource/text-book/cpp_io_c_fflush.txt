   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fflush( std::FILE* stream );

   For output streams (and for update streams on which the last operation
   was output), writes any unwritten data from the stream's buffer to the
   associated output device.

   For input streams (and for update streams on which the last operation
   was input), the behavior is undefined.

   If stream is a null pointer, all open output streams are flushed,
   including the ones manipulated within library packages or otherwise not
   directly accessible to the program.

Parameters

   stream - the file stream to write out

Return value

   Returns zero on success. Otherwise EOF is returned and the error
   indicator of the file stream is set.

Notes

   POSIX extends the specification of fflush by defining its effects on an
   input stream, as long as that stream represents a file or another
   seekable device: in that case the POSIX file pointer is repositioned to
   match the C stream pointer (which effectively undoes any read
   buffering) and the effects of any std::ungetc or std::ungetwc that
   weren't yet read back from the stream are discarded.

   Microsoft also extends the specification of fflush by defining its
   effects on an input stream: in Visual Studio 2013 and prior, it
   discarded the input buffer, in Visual Studio 2015 and newer, it has no
   effect, buffers are retained.
