   Defined in header <iomanip>
   /* unspecified */ setw( int n );

   When used in an expression out << std::setw(n) or in >> std::setw(n),
   sets the width parameter of the stream out or in to exactly n.

   Some operations reset the width to zero (see below), so std::setw may
   need to be repeatedly called to set the width for multiple operations.

Parameters

   n - new value for width

Return value

   An object of unspecified type such that
     * if out is an object of type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>, the
       expression out << setw(n)
          + has type std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>&
          + has value out
          + behaves as if it called f(out, n)
     * if in is an object of type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>, the
       expression in >> setw(n)
          + has type std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>&
          + has value in
          + behaves as if it called f(in, n)

   where the function f is defined as:
void f(std::ios_base& str, int n)
{
    // set width
    str.width(n);
}

Notes

   The width property of the stream will be reset to zero (meaning
   "unspecified") if any of the following functions are called:
     * Input

          + operator>>(basic_istream&, basic_string&)
          + operator>>(basic_istream&, char*)

     * Output

          + Overloads of basic_ostream::operator<<() that take arithmetic
            types or void pointers (at Stage 3 of num_put::put())
          + operator<<(basic_ostream&, char) and
            operator<<(basic_ostream&, char*)
          + operator<<(basic_ostream&, basic_string&)
          + std::put_money (inside money_put::put())
          + std::quoted (when used with an output stream)

   The exact effects this modifier has on the input and output vary
   between the individual I/O functions and are described at each
   operator<< and operator>> overload page individually.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::cout << "no setw: [" << 42 << "]\n"
              << "setw(6): [" << std::setw(6) << 42 << "]\n"
              << "no setw, several elements: [" << 89 << 12 << 34 << "]\n"
              << "setw(6), several elements: [" << 89 << std::setw(6) << 12 << 3
4 << "]\n";

    std::istringstream is("hello, world");
    char arr[10];

    is >> std::setw(6) >> arr;
    std::cout << "Input from \"" << is.str() << "\" with setw(6) gave \""
              << arr << "\"\n";
}

   Output:
no setw: [42]
setw(6): [    42]
no setw, several elements: [891234]
setw(6), several elements: [89    1234]
Input from "hello, world" with setw(6) gave "hello"

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 183 C++98 setw could only be used with streams of
   type std::ostream or std::istream usable with any
   character stream
