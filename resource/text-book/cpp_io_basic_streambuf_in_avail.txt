   std::streamsize in_avail();

   Returns the number of characters available in the get area. If a read
   position is available, effectively returns egptr() - gptr(), the size
   of the get area. In this case, the number of bytes returned is the
   number of bytes that can be extracted from the buffer without calling
   underflow().

   If the get area is empty, calls showmanyc() to determine the number of
   bytes available in the associated character sequence. In this case, the
   value returned is the number of bytes that can be extracted from the
   buffer while it's guaranteed that underflow() would not return
   Traits::eof.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The number of characters available for non-blocking read (either the
   size of the get area or the number of characters ready for reading from
   the associated character sequence), or -1 if no characters are
   available in the associated sequence as far as showmanyc() can tell.
