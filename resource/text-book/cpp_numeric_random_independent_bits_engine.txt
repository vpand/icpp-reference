   Defined in header <random>
   template<

       class Engine,
       std::size_t W,
       class UIntType
   > class independent_bits_engine;
                             (since C++11)

   independent_bits_engine is a random number engine adaptor that produces
   random numbers with different number of bits than that of the wrapped
   engine.

Template parameters

   Engine - the type of the wrapped engine
   W - the number of bits the generated numbers should have
   UIntType - the type of the generated random numbers. The effect is
   undefined unless the parameter is cv-unqualified and is one of unsigned
   short, unsigned int, unsigned long, or unsigned long long.
   Type requirements
   -
   Engine must meet the requirements of RandomNumberEngine.
   -
   W must be greater than zero, and no greater than
   std::numeric_limits<UIntType>::digits.

Member types

   Member type         Definition
   result_type (C++11) UIntType

Member functions

   (constructor)
   (C++11)
   constructs the engine adaptor
   (public member function)
   seed
   (C++11)
   sets the state of the underlying engine
   (public member function)
   base
   (C++11)
   returns the underlying engine
   (public member function)

Generation

   operator()
   (C++11)
   advances the state of the underlying engine and returns the generated
   value
   (public member function)
   discard
   (C++11)
   advances the adaptor's state by a specified amount
   (public member function)

Characteristics

   min
   [static] (C++11)
   gets the smallest possible value in the output range (always zero).
   (public static member function)
   max
   [static] (C++11)
   gets the largest possible value in the output range (always 2w
   - 1).
   (public static member function)

Non-member functions

   operator==operator!=
   (C++11)(C++11)(removed in C++20)
   compares the internal states of the adaptors and underlying engines
   (function)
   operator<<operator>>
   (C++11)
   performs stream input and output on pseudo-random number engine adaptor
   (function)
