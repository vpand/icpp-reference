   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto just_error( auto && error );
                                                      (since C++26)

Parameters

   error - input error which will be injected and returned by the
   receiver.

Return value

   Returns a sender with no completion schedulers, which sends the
   provided values.

Notes

   If the provided error is an lvalue reference, a copy is made inside the
   returned sender and a non-const lvalue reference to the copy is sent to
   the receiver's set_error. If the provided value is an rvalue reference,
   it is moved into the returned sender and an rvalue reference to it is
   sent to the receiver's set_error.
