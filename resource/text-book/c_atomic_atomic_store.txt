 Defined in header <stdatomic.h>
 void atomic_store( volatile A* obj , C desired );
 (1)                                                                 (since C11)
   void atomic_store_explicit( volatile A* obj, C desired, memory_order
   order );
 (2)                                                                 (since C11)

   Atomically replaces the value of the atomic variable pointed to by obj
   with desired. The operation is atomic write operation.

   The first version orders memory accesses according to
   memory_order_seq_cst, the second version orders memory accesses
   according to order. order must be one of memory_order_relaxed,
   memory_order_release or memory_order_seq_cst. Otherwise the behavior is
   undefined.

   This is a generic function defined for all atomic object types A. The
   argument is pointer to a volatile atomic type to accept addresses of
   both non-volatile and volatile (e.g. memory-mapped I/O) atomic objects,
   and volatile semantic is preserved when applying this operation to
   volatile atomic objects. C is the non-atomic type corresponding to A.

   It is unspecified whether the name of a generic function is a macro or
   an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is
   suppressed in order to access an actual function (e.g. parenthesized
   like (atomic_store)(...)), or a program defines an external identifier
   with the name of a generic function, the behavior is undefined.

Parameters

   obj   - pointer to the atomic object to modify
   order - the memory synchronization ordering for this operation

Return value

   (none)
