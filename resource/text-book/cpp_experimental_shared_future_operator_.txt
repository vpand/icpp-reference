   std::experimental::shared_future<T>& operator=( const
   std::experimental::shared_future<T>& other );
   (1)
   std::experimental::shared_future<T>& operator=(
   std::experimental::shared_future<T>&& other ) noexcept;
   (2)

   Assigns the contents of another std::experimental::shared_future
   object.
   1) Releases any shared state and assigns the contents of other to
   *this. After the assignment, this->valid() == other.valid().
   2) Releases any shared state and move-assigns the contents of other to
   *this. After the assignment, other.valid() == false and this->valid()
   will yield the same value as other.valid() before the assignment.

Parameters

   other - a std::experimental::shared_future object to assign from

Return value

   *this
