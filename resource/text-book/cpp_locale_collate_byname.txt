   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT >
   class collate_byname : public std::collate<CharT>;

   std::collate_byname is a std::collate facet which encapsulates
   locale-specific collation (comparison) and hashing of strings. Just
   like std::collate, it can be imbued in std::regex and applied, by means
   of std::locale::operator(), directly to all standard algorithms that
   expect a string comparison predicate.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations:
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::collate_byname<char> locale-specific collation of multibyte
   strings
   std::collate_byname<wchar_t> locale-specific collation of wide strings

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new collate_byname facet
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   destroys a collate_byname facet
   (protected member function)

std::collate_byname::collate_byname

   explicit collate_byname( const char* name, std::size_t refs = 0 );
   explicit collate_byname( const std::string& name, std::size_t refs = 0
   );
   (since C++11)

   Constructs a new std::collate_byname facet for a locale with name.

   refs is used for resource management: if refs == 0, the implementation
   destroys the facet, when the last std::locale object holding it is
   destroyed. Otherwise, the object is not destroyed.

Parameters

   name - the name of the locale
   refs - the number of references that link to the facet

std::collate_byname::~collate_byname

   protected:
   ~collate_byname();

   Destroys the facet.

Inherited from std::collate

Member functions

   compare

Protected member functions

   do_compare
   [virtual]
   compares two strings using this facet's collation rules
   (virtual protected member function of std::collate<CharT>)
   do_transform
   [virtual]
   transforms a string so that collation can be replaced by comparison
   (virtual protected member function of std::collate<CharT>)
   do_hash
   [virtual]
   generates an integer hash value using this facet's collation rules
   (virtual protected member function of std::collate<CharT>)

Notes

   Collation order is the dictionary order: the position of the letter in
   the national alphabet (its equivalence class) has higher priority than
   its case or variant. Within an equivalence class, lowercase characters
   collate before their uppercase equivalents and locale-specific order
   may apply to the characters with diacritics. In some locales, groups of
   characters compare as single collation units. For example, "ch" in
   Czech follows "h" and precedes "i", and "dzs" in Hungarian follows "dz"
   and precedes "g".
