   The TimedLockable requirements describe the characteristics of types
   that provide timed exclusive blocking semantics for execution agents
   (threads, processes, tasks).

Requirements

     * Lockable

   For type L to be TimedLockable, given
     * rel_time, a value of a specialization of std::chrono::duration, and
     * abs_time, a value of a specialization of std::chrono::time_point,

   the following conditions have to be satisfied for an object m of type
   L:
   Expression Effects Return value
   m.try_lock_for(rel_time) Blocks for the provided duration rel_time or
   until a lock on m is acquired. true if the lock was acquired, false
   otherwise.
   m.try_lock_until(abs_time) Blocks until the provided time point
   abs_time is reached or a lock on m is acquired. true if the lock was
   acquired, false otherwise.

Notes

   The try_lock_for and try_lock_until member functions obtain a
   non-shared lock on m on succcess.
