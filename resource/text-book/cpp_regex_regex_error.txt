   std::regex_error
   Member functions
   regex_error::regex_error
   regex_error::operator=
   regex_error::code

   Defined in header <regex>
   class regex_error;
                            (since C++11)

   Defines the type of exception object thrown to report errors in the
   regular expressions library.

   Inheritance diagram

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a regex_error object
   (public member function)
   operator=
   replaces the regex_error object
   (public member function)
   code
   gets the std::regex_constants::error_type for a regex_error
   (public member function)

Inherited from std::runtime_error

Inherited from std::exception

Member functions

   (destructor)
   [virtual]
   destroys the exception object
   (virtual public member function of std::exception)
   what
   [virtual]
   returns an explanatory string
   (virtual public member function of std::exception)

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <regex>

int main()
{
    try
    {
        std::regex re("[a-b][a");
    }
    catch (const std::regex_error& e)
    {
        std::cout << "regex_error caught: " << e.what() << '\n';
        if (e.code() == std::regex_constants::error_brack)
            std::cout << "The code was error_brack\n";
    }
}

   Possible output:
regex_error caught: The expression contained mismatched [ and ].
The code was error_brack
