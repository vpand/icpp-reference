   Defined in header <cwchar>
   const wchar_t* wcspbrk( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );
         wchar_t* wcspbrk(       wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

   Finds the first character in wide string pointed to by dest, that is
   also in wide string pointed to by src.

Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed
   src - pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the
   characters to search for

Return value

   Pointer to the first character in dest, that is also in src, or a null
   pointer if no such character exists.

Notes

   The name stands for "wide character string pointer break", because it
   returns a pointer to the first of the separator ("break") characters.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cwchar>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const wchar_t* str = L"Hello world, friend of mine!";
    const wchar_t* sep = L" ,!";

    unsigned int cnt = 0;
    do
    {
        str = std::wcspbrk(str, sep); // find separator
        std::wcout << std::quoted(str) << L'\n';
        if (str)
            str += std::wcsspn(str, sep); // skip separator
        ++cnt; // increment word count
    } while (str && *str);

    std::wcout << L"There are " << cnt << L" words\n";
}

   Output:
" world, friend of mine!"
", friend of mine!"
" of mine!"
" mine!"
"!"
There are 5 words
