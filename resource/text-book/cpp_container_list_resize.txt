   void resize( size_type count );
   (1)
   void resize( size_type count, const value_type& value );
   (2)

   Resizes the container to contain count elements, does nothing if count
   == size().

   If the current size is greater than count, the container is reduced to
   its first count elements.

   If the current size is less than count,
   1) additional default-inserted elements are appended.
   2) additional copies of value are appended.

Parameters

   count - new size of the container
   value - the value to initialize the new elements with
   Type requirements
   -
   T must meet the requirements of DefaultInsertable in order to use
   overload (1).
   -
   T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload
   (2).

Return value

   (none)

Complexity

   Linear in the difference between the current size and count.

Notes

   If value-initialization in overload (1) is undesirable, for example, if
   the elements are of non-class type and zeroing out is not needed, it
   can be avoided by providing a custom Allocator::construct.

Example

   Run this code
#include <list>
#include <iostream>

void print(auto rem, const std::list<int>& c)
{
    for (std::cout << rem; const int el : c)
        std::cout << el << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::list<int> c = {1, 2, 3};
    print("The list holds: ", c);

    c.resize(5);
    print("After resize up to 5: ", c);

    c.resize(2);
    print("After resize down to 2: ", c);

    c.resize(6, 4);
    print("After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): ", c);
}

   Output:
The list holds: 1 2 3
After resize up to 5: 1 2 3 0 0
After resize down to 2: 1 2
After resize up to 6 (initializer = 4): 1 2 4 4 4 4
