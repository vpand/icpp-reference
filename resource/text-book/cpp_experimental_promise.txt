   std::experimental::promise may refer to:
     * std::experimental::fundamentals_v1::promise or
       std::experimental::fundamentals_v2::promise, a modified version of
       std::promise provided by the library fundamentals TS with support
       for type-erased allocators;
     * std::experimental::concurrency_v1::promise, a modified version of
       std::promise provided by the concurrency TS whose get_future()
       member function returns the improved std::experimental::future
       provided by that TS.
