   Loads the data from the given locations, converts them to wide string
   equivalents and writes the results to a variety of sinks.
   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) If bufsz is greater than zero, writes the results to a wide string
   buffer. At most bufsz - 1 wide characters are written followed by null
   wide character. If bufsz is zero, nothing is written (and buffer may be
   a null pointer).
   4-6) Same as (1-3), except that the following errors are detected at
   runtime and call the currently installed constraint handler function:

          + the conversion specifier %n is present in format
          + any of the arguments corresponding to %s is a null pointer
          + format or buffer is a null pointer
          + bufsz is zero or greater than RSIZE_MAX / sizeof(wchar_t)
          + encoding errors occur in any of string and character
            conversion specifiers
          + (only for swprintf_s) the number of wide characters to be
            written, including the null, would exceed bufsz.

   7) Same as (6), except it will truncate the result to fit within the
   array pointed to by s.

          As with all bounds-checked functions, wprintf_s , fwprintf_s,
          swprintf_s, and snwprintf_s are only guaranteed to be available
          if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the implementation and if the
          user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1
          before including <stdio.h>.

Parameters

   stream - output file stream to write to
   buffer - pointer to a wide character string to write to
   bufsz - up to bufsz - 1 wide characters may be written, plus the null
   terminator
   format - pointer to a null-terminated wide string specifying how to
   interpret the data
   ... - arguments specifying data to print. If any argument after default
   argument promotions is not the type expected by the corresponding
   conversion specifier, or if there are fewer arguments than required by
   format, the behavior is undefined. If there are more arguments than
   required by format, the extraneous arguments are evaluated and ignored.

   The format string consists of ordinary wide characters (except %),
   which are copied unchanged into the output stream, and conversion
   specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

          + introductory % character.

          + (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the
            conversion:

               o -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within
                 the field (by default it is right-justified).
               o +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to
                 the result of the conversion (by default the result is
                 preceded by minus only when it is negative).
               o space: if the result of a signed conversion does not
                 start with a sign character, or is empty, space is
                 prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is
                 present.
               o #: alternative form of the conversion is performed. See
                 the table below for exact effects otherwise the behavior
                 is undefined.
               o 0: for integer and floating-point number conversions,
                 leading zeros are used to pad the field instead of space
                 characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the
                 precision is explicitly specified. For other conversions
                 using this flag results in undefined behavior. It is
                 ignored if - flag is present.

          + (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field
            width. The result is padded with space characters (by
            default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on
            the right if left-justified. In the case when * is used, the
            width is specified by an additional argument of type int,
            which appears before the argument to be converted and the
            argument supplying precision if one is supplied. If the value
            of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag
            specified and positive field width (Note: This is the minimum
            width: The value is never truncated.).

          + (optional) . followed by integer number or *, or neither that
            specifies precision of the conversion. In the case when * is
            used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of
            type int, which appears before the argument to be converted,
            but after the argument supplying minimum field width if one is
            supplied. If the value of this argument is negative, it is
            ignored. If neither a number nor * is used, the precision is
            taken as zero. See the table below for exact effects of
            precision.

          + (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the
            argument (in combination with the conversion format specifier,
            it specifies the type of the corresponding argument).

          + conversion format specifier.

   The following format specifiers are available:

   array containing a multibyte character sequence beginning in the
   initial shift state, which is converted to wide character array as if
   by a call to mbrtowc with zero-initialized conversion state. Precision
   specifies the maximum number of wide characters to be written. If
   Precision is not specified, writes every wide characters up to and not
   including the first null terminator. If the l specifier is used, the
   argument must be a pointer to the initial element of an array of
   wchar_t.

   Precision specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the
   decimal point character. The default precision is 6. In the alternative
   implementation decimal point character is written even if no digits
   follow it. For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.

   For the e conversion style [-]d.ddde±dd is used.
   For the E conversion style [-]d.dddE±dd is used.
   The exponent contains at least two digits, more digits are used only if
   necessary. If the value is 0, the exponent is also 0. Precision
   specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the decimal point
   character. The default precision is 6. In the alternative
   implementation decimal point character is written even if no digits
   follow it. For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.

   For the a conversion style [-]0xh.hhhp±d is used.
   For the A conversion style [-]0Xh.hhhP±d is used.
   The first hexadecimal digit is not 0 if the argument is a normalized
   floating-point value. If the value is 0, the exponent is also 0.
   Precision specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the
   hexadecimal point character. The default precision is sufficient for
   exact representation of the value. In the alternative implementation
   decimal point character is written even if no digits follow it. For
   infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.

   g
   G

          Converts floating-point number to decimal or decimal exponent
          notation depending on the value and the precision.

   For the g conversion style conversion with style e or f will be
   performed.
   For the G conversion style conversion with style E or F will be
   performed.
   Let P equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is not
   specified, or 1 if the precision is 0. Then, if a conversion with style
   E would have an exponent of X:
     * if P > X >= -4, the conversion is with style f or F and precision P
       - 1 - X.
     * otherwise, the conversion is with style e or E and precision P - 1.

   Unless alternative representation is requested the trailing zeros are
   removed, also the decimal point character is removed if no fractional
   part is left. For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.
   N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
   n

          Returns the number of characters written so far by this call to
          the function.

   The result is written to the value pointed to by the argument. The
   specification may not contain any flag, field width, or precision.

   The floating-point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or
   infinity. Which one is used is implementation defined.

   Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is
   used is implementation defined.

   The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.

   Even though %c expects int argument, it is safe to pass a char because
   of the integer promotion that takes place when a variadic function is
   called.

   The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character
   types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the header <inttypes.h> (although
   PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju, etc).

   The memory-writing conversion specifier %n is a common target of
   security exploits where format strings depend on user input and is not
   supported by the bounds-checked printf_s family of functions.

   There is a sequence point after the action of each conversion
   specifier; this permits storing multiple %n results in the same
   variable or, as an edge case, printing a string modified by an earlier
   %n within the same call.

   If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

Return value

   1,2) Number of wide characters written if successful or negative value
   if an error occurred.
   3) Number of wide characters written (not counting the terminating null
   wide character) if successful or negative value if an encoding error
   occurred or if the number of characters to be generated was equal or
   greater than bufsz (including when bufsz is zero).
   4,5) Number of wide characters written if successful or negative value
   if an error occurred.
   6) Number of wide characters (not counting the terminating null) that
   were written to buffer. Returns a negative value on encoding errors and
   on overflow. Returns zero on all other errors.
   7) Number of wide characters (not counting the terminating null) that
   would have been written to buffer had bufsz been sufficiently large, or
   a negative value if an error occurs. (meaning, write was successful and
   complete only if the return is nonnegative and less than bufsz)

Notes

   While narrow strings provide snprintf, which makes it possible to
   determine the required output buffer size, there is no equivalent for
   wide strings (until snwprintf_s)(since C11), and in order to determine
   the buffer size, the program may need to call swprintf, check the
   result value, and reallocate a larger buffer, trying again until
   successful.

   snwprintf_s, unlike swprintf_s, will truncate the result to fit within
   the array pointed to by buffer, even though truncation is treated as an
   error by most bounds-checked functions.

Example

   Run this code
#include <locale.h>
#include <wchar.h>

int main(void)
{
    char narrow_str[] = "z\u00df\u6c34\U0001f34c";
                  // or "zﬂ¥"
                  // or "\x7a\xc3\x9f\xe6\xb0\xb4\xf0\x9f\x8d\x8c";
    wchar_t warr[29]; // the expected string is 28 characters plus 1 null termin
ator
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    swprintf(warr, sizeof warr / sizeof* warr,
             L"Converted from UTF-8: '%s'", narrow_str);
    wprintf(L"%ls\n", warr);
}

   Output:
Converted from UTF-8: 'zﬂ¥'
