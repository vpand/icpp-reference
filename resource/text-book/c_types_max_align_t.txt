   Defined in header <stddef.h>
   typedef /*implementation-defined*/ max_align_t;
                                                  (since C11)

   max_align_t is a type whose alignment requirement is at least as strict
   (as large) as that of every scalar type.

Notes

   Pointers returned by allocation functions such as malloc are suitably
   aligned for any object, which means they are aligned at least as
   strictly as max_align_t.

Example

   Run this code
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdalign.h>
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    size_t a = alignof(max_align_t);
    printf("Alignment of max_align_t is %zu (%#zx)\n", a, a);

    void *p = malloc(123);
    printf("The address obtained from malloc(123) is %#" PRIxPTR"\n",
            (uintptr_t)p);
    free(p);
}

   Possible output:
Alignment of max_align_t is 16 (0x10)
The address obtained from malloc(123) is 0x1fa67010
