   Defined in header <stdatomic.h>
   C atomic_fetch_add( volatile A* obj, M arg );
   (1) (since C11)
   C atomic_fetch_add_explicit( volatile A* obj, M arg, memory_order order
   );
   (2) (since C11)

   Atomically replaces the value pointed by obj with the result of
   addition of arg to the old value of obj, and returns the value obj held
   previously. The operation is read-modify-write operation. The first
   version orders memory accesses according to memory_order_seq_cst, the
   second version orders memory accesses according to order.

   This is a generic function defined for all atomic object types A. The
   argument is pointer to a volatile atomic type to accept addresses of
   both non-volatile and volatile (e.g. memory-mapped I/O) atomic objects,
   and volatile semantic is preserved when applying this operation to
   volatile atomic objects. M is either the non-atomic type corresponding
   to A if A is atomic integer type, or ptrdiff_t if A is atomic pointer
   type.

   It is unspecified whether the name of a generic function is a macro or
   an identifier declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is
   suppressed in order to access an actual function (e.g. parenthesized
   like (atomic_fetch_add)(...)), or a program defines an external
   identifier with the name of a generic function, the behavior is
   undefined.

   For signed integer types, arithmetic is defined to use two's complement
   representation. There are no undefined results. For pointer types, the
   result may be an undefined address, but the operations otherwise have
   no undefined behavior.

Parameters

   obj - pointer to the atomic object to modify
   arg - the value to add to the value stored in the atomic object
   order - the memory synchronization ordering for this operation: all
   values are permitted

Return value

   The value held previously by the atomic object pointed to by obj.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <threads.h>
#include <stdatomic.h>

atomic_int acnt;
int cnt;

int f(void* thr_data)
{
    for(int n = 0; n < 1000; ++n) {
        atomic_fetch_add_explicit(&acnt, 1, memory_order_relaxed); // atomic
        ++cnt; // undefined behavior, in practice some updates missed
    }
    return 0;
}

int main(void)
{
    thrd_t thr[10];
    for(int n = 0; n < 10; ++n)
        thrd_create(&thr[n], f, NULL);
    for(int n = 0; n < 10; ++n)
        thrd_join(thr[n], NULL);

    printf("The atomic counter is %u\n", acnt);
    printf("The non-atomic counter is %u\n", cnt);
}

   Possible output:
The atomic counter is 10000
The non-atomic counter is 9511
