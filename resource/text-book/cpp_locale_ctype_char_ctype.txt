   Defined in header <locale>
   explicit ctype( const mask* tbl = 0, bool del = false, std::size_t refs
   = 0);

   Creates a std::ctype<char> facet and forwards the starting reference
   count refs to the base class constructor, locale::facet::facet().

   If tbl is null, classic_table() is used by all classification member
   functions. Otherwise, tbl must be a pointer to the first element of an
   array of masks, at least std::ctype<char>::table_size in size, and that
   array is used by all of this facet's classification member functions.

   If del is true, it is assumed that the array was allocated with new[],
   and the destructor of this facet will call delete[] tbl.

Parameters

   tbl  - classification table to use or a null pointer
   del  - indicator whether the table needs to be deleted
   refs - starting reference count
