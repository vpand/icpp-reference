   Defined in header <time.h>
   time_t time( time_t *arg );

   Returns the current calendar time encoded as a time_t object, and also
   stores it in the time_t object pointed to by arg (unless arg is a null
   pointer)

Parameters

   arg - pointer to a time_t object where the time will be stored, or a
   null pointer

Return value

   Current calendar time encoded as time_t object on success, (time_t)(-1)
   on error. If arg is not a null pointer, the return value is also stored
   in the object pointed to by arg.

Notes

   The encoding of calendar time in time_t is unspecified, but most
   systems conform to POSIX specification and return a value of integral
   type holding the number of seconds since the Epoch. Implementations in
   which time_t is a 32-bit signed integer (many historical
   implementations) fail in the year 2038.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(void)
{
    time_t result = time(NULL);
    if(result != (time_t)(-1))
        printf("The current time is %s(%jd seconds since the Epoch)\n",
               asctime(gmtime(&result)), (intmax_t)result);
}

   Possible output:
The current time is Fri Apr 24 15:05:25 2015
(1429887925 seconds since the Epoch)
