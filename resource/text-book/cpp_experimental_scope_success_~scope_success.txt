   ~scope_success() noexcept(noexcept(std::declval<EF&>()()));
   (library fundamentals TS v3)

   Calls the exit function if the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() is
   less than or equal to the counter of uncaught exceptions (typically on
   normal exit) and the scope_success is active, then destroys the stored
   EF (if it is a function object) and any other non-static data members.

Exceptions

   Throws any exception thrown by calling the exit function.

Notes

   Whether the destructor is called on stack unwinding can be detected by
   the comparison of the result of std::uncaught_exceptions() and the
   counter of uncaught exceptions in the scope_success.

   Unlike other classes or class template specializations in the C++
   standard library and other C++ TR/TS's, scope_success's destructor is
   permitted to throw an exception.
