  Defined in header <stdlib.h>
  void free_aligned_sized( void* ptr, size_t alignment, size_t size);
                                                                     (since C23)

   If ptr is a null pointer or the result obtained from a call to
   aligned_alloc, where alignment is equal to the requested allocation
   alignment and size is equal to the requested allocation size, this
   function is equivalent to free(ptr). Otherwise, the behavior is
   undefined.

   Note: The result of an malloc, calloc, or realloc call may not be
   passed to free_aligned_sized.

Parameters

   ptr       - pointer to the memory to deallocate
   alignment - alignment of memory to deallocate
   size      - size of memory to deallocate

Return value

   (none)
