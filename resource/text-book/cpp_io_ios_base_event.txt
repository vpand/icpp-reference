   enum event { erase_event, imbue_event, copyfmt_event };

   Specifies the event type which is passed to functions registered by
   register_callback() on specific events. The following constants are
   defined:
   Constant Explanation
   erase_event issued on ~ios_base() or basic_ios::copyfmt() (before the
   copy of members takes place)
   imbue_event issued on imbue()
   copyfmt_event issued on basic_ios::copyfmt() (after the copy of members
   takes place, but before the exception settings are copied)
