   Defined in header <cwchar>
   wchar_t* wmemcpy( wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, std::size_t count
   );

   Copies exactly count successive wide characters from the wide character
   array pointed to by src to the wide character array pointed to by dest.
   If the objects overlap, the behavior is undefined. If count is zero,
   the function does nothing.

Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the wide character array to copy to
   src   - pointer to the wide character array to copy from
   count - number of wide characters to copy

Return value

   dest

Notes

   This function's analog for byte strings is std::strncpy, not
   std::strcpy.

   This function is not locale-sensitive and pays no attention to the
   values of the wchar_t objects it copies: nulls as well as invalid
   characters are copied too.

Example

   Run this code
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>

int main(void)
{
    const wchar_t from1[] = L"¨®¸¤";
    const wchar_t from2[] = L"²¡";
    const std::size_t sz1 = std::size(from1);
    const std::size_t sz2 = std::size(from2);
    wchar_t to[sz1 + sz2];

    std::wmemcpy(to, from1, sz1); // copy from1, along with its null terminator
    std::wmemcpy(to + sz1, from2, sz2); // append from2, along with its null ter
minator

    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    std::wcout << L"Wide array contains: ";
    for (std::size_t n = 0; n < std::size(to); ++n)
        if (to[n])
            std::wcout << to[n];
        else
            std::wcout << L"\\0";
    std::wcout << L'\n';
}

   Possible output:
Wide array contains: ¨®¸¤\0²¡\0
