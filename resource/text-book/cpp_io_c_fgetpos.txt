   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int fgetpos( std::FILE* stream, std::fpos_t* pos );

   Obtains the file position indicator and the current parse state (if
   any) for the file stream stream and stores them in the object pointed
   to by pos. The value stored is only meaningful as the input to
   std::fsetpos.

Parameters

   stream - file stream to examine
   pos - pointer to a fpos_t object to store the file position indicator
   to

Return value

   0 upon success, nonzero value otherwise. Also sets errno on failure.
