   protected:

   virtual pos_type seekoff( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir,

   (2)

   Sets the position indicator of the input and/or output sequence
   relative to some other position.
   1) Calls seekoff(off, dir, which) of the most derived class.
   2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived
   classes may override this function to allow relative positioning of the
   position indicator.

Parameters

   off - relative position to set the position indicator to.
   dir - defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be
   one of the following constants:
   Constant Explanation
   beg      the beginning of a stream
   end      the ending of a stream
   cur      the current position of stream position indicator
   which - defines which of the input and/or output sequences to affect.
   It can be one or a combination of the following constants:
   Constant Explanation
   in       affect the input sequence
   out      affect the output sequence

Note

   Not all combinations of parameters may be valid, see the derived
   versions of seekoff for details.

Return value

   1) The return value of seekoff(off, dir, which)
   2) The resulting absolute position as defined by the position
   indicator. The base class version returns pos_type(off_type(-1)).

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 55 C++98 the base class version of seekoff returned
   an undefined invalid stream position returns pos_type(off_type(-1))
