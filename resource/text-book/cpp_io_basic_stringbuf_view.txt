   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> view() const noexcept;
                                                               (since C++20)

   Creates and returns a std::basic_string_view over the underlying
   character sequence.
     * For input-only streams, the returned view represents the range
       [eback(), egptr()).
     * For input/output or output-only streams, references the characters
       from pbase() to the last character in the sequence regardless of
       egptr() and epptr().
     * If the stream is neither input nor output, returns
       std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits>{}.

   The member character sequence in a buffer open for writing can be
   over-allocated for efficiency purposes. In that case, only the
   initialized characters are referenced: these characters are the ones
   that were obtained from the string argument of the constructor, the
   string argument used by the most recent call to a setter overload of
   str(), or from a write operation. A typical implementation that uses
   over-allocation maintains a high-watermark pointer to track the end of
   the initialized part of the buffer and the returned view references the
   characters from pbase() to the high-watermark pointer.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   A view over the underlying character sequence.

Notes

   Using of the return value is undefined behavior if the underlying
   character sequence is destroyed or invalidated, unless the return value
   is empty.

   This function is typically accessed through
   std::basic_istringstream::view(), std::basic_ostringstream::view(), or
   std::basic_stringstream::view().
