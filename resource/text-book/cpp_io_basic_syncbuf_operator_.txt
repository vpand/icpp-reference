   basic_syncbuf& operator=( basic_syncbuf&& other );

   First, calls emit() to transmit all pending output (and delayed flush,
   if any) to the wrapped stream.

   Then performs move-assignment by moving all contents from other,
   including the temporary storage, the wrapped stream pointer, policy,
   and all other state (such as the mutex pointer). After move, other is
   not associated with a stream, and other.get_wrapped() == nullptr. The
   put area member pointers of the base class std::basic_streambuf of
   other are guaranteed to be null. Destroying a moved-from other will not
   produce any output.

   If
   std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::propagate_on_container_move_assignmen
   t::value is false, then the allocator is unchanged. Otherwise, after
   move-assignment, get_allocator() equals other.get_allocator().

Parameters

   other - another std::basic_syncbuf to move from

Return value

   *this
