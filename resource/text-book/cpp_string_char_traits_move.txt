   static char_type*
       move( char_type* dest, const char_type* src, std::size_t count );
                    (constexpr since C++20)

   Copies count characters from the character string pointed to by src to
   the character string pointed to by dest.

   Performs correctly even if the ranges [src, src + count) and
   [dest, dest + count) overlap.

   See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for
   X::move.

Parameters

   dest  - pointer to a character string to copy to
   src   - pointer to a character string to copy from
   count - the number of characters to copy

Return value

   dest

Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

Complexity

   Linear in count.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 7 C++98 the copy was guaranteed to perform correctly if
   src is in [dest, dest + count), but not the other
   way round (i.e. dest is in [src, src + count)) also guaranteed
