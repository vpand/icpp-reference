   basic_istream& read( char_type* s, std::streamsize count );

   Extracts characters from stream.

   Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction. After constructing and checking
   the sentry object, extracts characters and stores them into successive
   locations of the character array whose first element is pointed to by
   s. Characters are extracted and stored until any of the following
   conditions occurs:
     * count characters were extracted and stored.

     * end of file condition occurs on the input sequence (in which case,
       setstate(failbit|eofbit) is called). The number of successfully
       extracted characters can be queried using gcount().

Parameters

   s     - pointer to the character array to store the characters to
   count - number of characters to read

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and
   exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit
   is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

Notes

   When using a non-converting locale (the default locale is
   non-converting), the overrider of this function in std::basic_ifstream
   may be optimized for zero-copy bulk I/O (by means of overriding
   std::streambuf::xsgetn).

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdint>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    // read() is often used for binary I/O
    std::string bin = {'\x12', '\x12', '\x12', '\x12'};
    std::istringstream raw(bin);
    std::uint32_t n;
    if (raw.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&n), sizeof n))
        std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase << n << '\n';

    // prepare file for next snippet
    std::ofstream("test.txt", std::ios::binary) << "abcd1\nabcd2\nabcd3";

    // read entire file into string
    if (std::ifstream is{"test.txt", std::ios::binary | std::ios::ate})
    {
        auto size = is.tellg();
        std::string str(size, '\0'); // construct string to stream size
        is.seekg(0);
        if (is.read(&str[0], size))
            std::cout << str << '\n';
    }
}

   Output:
0x12121212
abcd1
abcd2
abcd3
