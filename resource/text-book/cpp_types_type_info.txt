   type_info::name

   Defined in header <typeinfo>
   class type_info;

   The class type_info holds implementation-specific information about a
   type, including the name of the type and means to compare two types for
   equality or collating order. This is the class returned by the typeid
   operator.

   The type_info class is neither CopyConstructible nor CopyAssignable.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   [deleted]
   has neither default nor copy constructors
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   [virtual]
   the virtual destructor makes type_info a polymorphic class
   (virtual public member function)
   operator=
   [deleted]
   can not be copy-assigned
   (public member function)
   operator==operator!=
   (removed in C++20)
   checks whether the objects refer to the same type
   (public member function)
   before
   checks whether the referred type precedes referred type of another
   type_info
   object in the implementation defined order, i.e. orders the referred
   types
   (public member function)
   hash_code
   (C++11)
   returns a value which is identical for the same types
   (public member function)
   name
   implementation defined name of the type
   (public member function)
