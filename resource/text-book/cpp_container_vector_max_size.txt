   size_type max_size() const;
   (noexcept since C++11)
   (constexpr since C++20)

   Returns the maximum number of elements the container is able to hold
   due to system or library implementation limitations, i.e.
   std::distance(begin(), end()) for the largest container.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   Maximum number of elements.

Complexity

   Constant.

Notes

   This value typically reflects the theoretical limit on the size of the
   container, at most std::numeric_limits<difference_type>::max(). At
   runtime, the size of the container may be limited to a value smaller
   than max_size() by the amount of RAM available.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<char> p;
    std::vector<long> q;

    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << std::uppercase
              << "p.max_size() = " << std::dec << p.max_size() << " = 0x"
              << std::hex << p.max_size() << '\n'
              << "q.max_size() = " << std::dec << q.max_size() << " = 0x"
              << std::hex << q.max_size() << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
p.max_size() = 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 = 0x7,FFF,FFF,FFF,FFF,FFF
q.max_size() = 1,152,921,504,606,846,975 = 0xFFF,FFF,FFF,FFF,FFF
