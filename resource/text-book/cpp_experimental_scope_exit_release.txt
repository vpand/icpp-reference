   void release() noexcept;
                           (library fundamentals TS v3)

   Makes the scope_exit inactive.

   Once a scope_exit is inactive, it cannot become active again, and will
   not call its exit function on destruction.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)

Notes

   release may be either manually called or automatically called by
   scope_exit's move constructor.
