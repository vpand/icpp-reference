   Defined in header <stdlib.h>
   void abort(void);
                                 (until C11)
   _Noreturn void abort(void);
   (since C11)
   (until C23)
   [[noreturn]] void abort(void);
                                 (since C23)

   Causes abnormal program termination unless SIGABRT is being caught by a
   signal handler passed to signal and the handler does not return.

   Functions passed to atexit() are not called. Whether open resources
   such as files are closed is implementation defined. An implementation
   defined status is returned to the host environment that indicates
   unsuccessful execution.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)

Notes

   POSIX specifies that the abort() function overrides blocking or
   ignoring the SIGABRT signal.

   Some compiler intrinsics, e.g. __builtin_trap (gcc, clang, and icc) or
   __fastfail/__debugbreak (msvc), can be used to terminate the program as
   fast as possible.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    FILE *fp = fopen("data.txt","r");
    if (fp == NULL)
    {
        fprintf(stderr, "error opening file data.txt in function main()\n");
        abort();
    }

    /* Normal processing continues here. */
    fclose(fp);
    printf("Normal Return\n");
    return 0;
}

   Output:
error opening file data.txt in function main()
