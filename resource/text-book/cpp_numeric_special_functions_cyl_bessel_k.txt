   Additional overloads
   Defined in header <cmath>
   template< class Arithmetic1, class Arithmetic2 >

   /* common-floating-point-type */
       cyl_bessel_k( Arithmetic1 nu, Arithmetic2 x );
   (A) (since C++17)
   1-3) Computes the irregular modified cylindrical Bessel function (also
   known as modified Bessel function of the second kind) of nu and x. The
   library provides overloads of std::cyl_bessel_k for all cv-unqualified
   floating-point types as the type of the parameters nu and x.(since
   C++23)
   A) Additional overloads are provided for all other combinations of
   arithmetic types.

Parameters

   nu - the order of the function
   x  - the argument of the function

Return value

   If no errors occur, value of the irregular modified cylindrical Bessel
   function (modified Bessel function of the second kind) of nu and x, is
   returned, that is K
   nu(x) =
   p
   2
   I
   -nu(x)-I
   nu(x)
   sin(nup)
   (where I
   nu(x) is std::cyl_bessel_i(nu, x)) for x>=0 and non-integer nu; for
   integer nu a limit is used.

Error handling

   Errors may be reported as specified in math_errhandling:
     * If the argument is NaN, NaN is returned and domain error is not
       reported.
     * If nu>=128, the behavior is implementation-defined.

Notes

   Implementations that do not support C++17, but support ISO 29124:2010,
   provide this function if __STDCPP_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__ is defined by the
   implementation to a value at least 201003L and if the user defines
   __STDCPP_WANT_MATH_SPEC_FUNCS__ before including any standard library
   headers.

   Implementations that do not support ISO 29124:2010 but support TR
   19768:2007 (TR1), provide this function in the header tr1/cmath and
   namespace std::tr1.

   An implementation of this function is also available in boost.math.

   The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as
   (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their first
   argument num1 and second argument num2:
     * If num1 or num2 has type long double, then std::cyl_bessel_k(num1,
       num2) has the same effect as std::cyl_bessel_k(static_cast<long
       double>(num1),
                         static_cast<long double>(num2)).
     * Otherwise, if num1 and/or num2 has type double or an integer type,
       then std::cyl_bessel_k(num1, num2) has the same effect as
       std::cyl_bessel_k(static_cast<double>(num1),
                         static_cast<double>(num2)).
     * Otherwise, if num1 or num2 has type float, then
       std::cyl_bessel_k(num1, num2) has the same effect as
       std::cyl_bessel_k(static_cast<float>(num1),
                         static_cast<float>(num2)).

   (until C++23)

   If num1 and num2 have arithmetic types, then std::cyl_bessel_k(num1,
   num2) has the same effect as std::cyl_bessel_k(static_cast</*
   common-floating-point-type */>(num1),
                     static_cast</* common-floating-point-type */>(num2)),
   where /* common-floating-point-type */ is the floating-point type with
   the greatest floating-point conversion rank and greatest floating-point
   conversion subrank between the types of num1 and num2, arguments of
   integer type are considered to have the same floating-point conversion
   rank as double.

   If no such floating-point type with the greatest rank and subrank
   exists, then overload resolution does not result in a usable candidate
   from the overloads provided.
   (since C++23)

Example

   Run this code
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <numbers>

int main()
{
    double pi = std::numbers::pi;
    const double x = 1.2345;

    // spot check for nu == 0.5
    std::cout << "K_.5(" << x << ") = " << std::cyl_bessel_k(.5, x) << '\n'
              << "calculated via I = "
              << (pi / 2) * (std::cyl_bessel_i(-.5, x)
                 - std::cyl_bessel_i(.5, x)) / std::sin(.5 * pi) << '\n';
}

   Output:
K_.5(1.2345) = 0.32823
calculated via I = 0.32823
