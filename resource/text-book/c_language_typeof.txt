   Determines the type of an object.

Syntax

   typeof( type )              (1)
   typeof( expression )        (2)
   typeof_unqual( type )       (3)
   typeof_unqual( expression ) (4)

Explanation

   1) produces the type-name with any nested typeof-specifier evaluated
   2) yields the type-name representing the type of its operand. No
   implicit conversions are applied to expression.
   3,4) the same as (1) and (2) respectively but remove qualifiers

Notes

   typeof and typeof_unqual are collectively called the typeof operators.
   The typeof operators cannot be applied to bit-field members. If the
   type of the operand is a variably modified type, the operand is
   evaluated; otherwise, the operand is not evaluated. The result of the
   typeof_unqual operator is the non-atomic unqualified type that would
   result from the typeof operator. The typeof operator preserves all
   qualifiers.
