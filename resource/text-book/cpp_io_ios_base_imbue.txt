   as a parameter.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 47 C++98 the return value was misspecified as the return value of
   getloc() corrected
   LWG 156 C++98 the type of loc was const std::locale corrected to const
   std::locale&
