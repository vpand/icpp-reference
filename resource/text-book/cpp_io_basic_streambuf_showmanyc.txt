   protected:
   virtual std::streamsize showmanyc();

   Estimates the number of characters available for input in the
   associated character sequence. underflow() is guaranteed not to return
   Traits::eof() or throw an exception until at least that many characters
   are extracted.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The number of characters that are certainly available in the associated
   character sequence, or -1 if showmanyc can determine, without blocking,
   that no characters are available. If showmanyc returns -1, underflow()
   and uflow() will definitely return Traits::eof or throw.

   The base class version returns 0, which has the meaning of "unsure if
   there are characters available in the associated sequence".

Notes

   The name of this function stands for "stream: how many characters?", so
   it is pronounced "S how many C", rather than "show many C".

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 159 C++98 underflow() is guaranteed not to fail until
   at least showmanyc() characters are supplied extended the guarantee to
   allow at least
   showmanyc() characters to be extracted
