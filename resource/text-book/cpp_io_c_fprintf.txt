   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int printf( const char* format, ... );
   (1)
   int fprintf( std::FILE* stream, const char* format, ... );
   (2)
   int sprintf( char* buffer, const char* format, ... );
   (3)
   int snprintf( char* buffer, std::size_t buf_size, const char* format,
   ... );
   (4) (since C++11)

   Loads the data from the given locations, converts them to character
   string equivalents and writes the results to a variety of sinks.
   1) Writes the results to stdout.
   2) Writes the results to a file stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a character string buffer.
   4) Writes the results to a character string buffer. At most buf_size -
   1 characters are written. The resulting character string will be
   terminated with a null character, unless buf_size is zero. If buf_size
   is zero, nothing is written and buffer may be a null pointer, however
   the return value (number of bytes that would be written not including
   the null terminator) is still calculated and returned.

   If a call to sprintf or snprintf causes copying to take place between
   objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined (e.g. sprintf(buf, "%s
   text", buf);).

Parameters

   stream - output file stream to write to
   buffer - pointer to a character string to write to
   buf_size - up to buf_size - 1 characters may be written, plus the null
   terminator
   format - pointer to a null-terminated multibyte string specifying how
   to interpret the data
   ... - arguments specifying data to print. If any argument after default
   conversions is not the type expected by the corresponding conversion
   specifier, or if there are fewer arguments than required by format, the
   behavior is undefined. If there are more arguments than required by
   format, the extraneous arguments are evaluated and ignored

   The format string consists of ordinary byte characters (except %),
   which are copied unchanged into the output stream, and conversion
   specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

          + introductory % character.

          + (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the
            conversion:

               o -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within
                 the field (by default it is right-justified).
               o +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to
                 the result of the conversion (by default the result is
                 preceded by minus only when it is negative).
               o space: if the result of a signed conversion does not
                 start with a sign character, or is empty, space is
                 prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is
                 present.
               o #: alternative form of the conversion is performed. See
                 the table below for exact effects otherwise the behavior
                 is undefined.
               o 0: for integer and floating-point number conversions,
                 leading zeros are used to pad the field instead of space
                 characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the
                 precision is explicitly specified. For other conversions
                 using this flag results in undefined behavior. It is
                 ignored if - flag is present.

          + (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field
            width. The result is padded with space characters (by
            default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on
            the right if left-justified. In the case when * is used, the
            width is specified by an additional argument of type int,
            which appears before the argument to be converted and the
            argument supplying precision if one is supplied. If the value
            of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag
            specified and positive field width (Note: This is the minimum
            width: The value is never truncated.).

          + (optional) . followed by integer number or *, or neither that
            specifies precision of the conversion. In the case when * is
            used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of
            type int, which appears before the argument to be converted,
            but after the argument supplying minimum field width if one is
            supplied. If the value of this argument is negative, it is
            ignored. If neither a number nor * is used, the precision is
            taken as zero. See the table below for exact effects of
            precision.

          + (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the
            argument (in combination with the conversion format specifier,
            it specifies the type of the corresponding argument).

          + conversion format specifier.

   The following format specifiers are available:

          Writes a character string

   The argument must be a pointer to the initial element of an array of
   characters. Precision specifies the maximum number of bytes to be
   written. If Precision is not specified, writes every byte up to and not
   including the first null terminator. If the l specifier is used, the
   argument must be a pointer to the initial element of an array of
   wchar_t, which is converted to char array as if by a call to wcrtomb
   with zero-initialized conversion state.

   Precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear. The default
   precision is 1. If both the converted value and the precision are 0 the
   conversion results in no characters. In the alternative implementation
   precision is increased if necessary, to write one leading zero. In that
   case if both the converted value and the precision are 0, single 0 is
   written.

   For the x conversion letters abcdef are used.
   For the X conversion letters ABCDEF are used.
   Precision specifies the minimum number of digits to appear. The default
   precision is 1. If both the converted value and the precision are 0 the
   conversion results in no characters. In the alternative implementation
   0x or 0X is prefixed to results if the converted value is nonzero.

          Converts floating-point number to the decimal notation in the
          style [-]ddd.ddd.

   Precision specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the
   decimal point character. The default precision is 6. In the alternative
   implementation decimal point character is written even if no digits
   follow it. For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.

          Converts floating-point number to the decimal exponent notation.

   For the e conversion style [-]d.ddde±dd is used.
   For the E conversion style [-]d.dddE±dd is used.
   The exponent contains at least two digits, more digits are used only if
   necessary. If the value is 0, the exponent is also 0. Precision
   specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the decimal point
   character. The default precision is 6. In the alternative
   implementation decimal point character is written even if no digits
   follow it. For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.

   For the a conversion style [-]0xh.hhhp±d is used.
   For the A conversion style [-]0Xh.hhhP±d is used.
   The first hexadecimal digit is not 0 if the argument is a normalized
   floating-point value. If the value is 0, the exponent is also 0.
   Precision specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the
   hexadecimal point character. The default precision is sufficient for
   exact representation of the value. In the alternative implementation
   decimal point character is written even if no digits follow it. For
   infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.
   N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
   g
   G

          Converts floating-point number to decimal or decimal exponent
          notation depending on the value and the precision.

   For the g conversion style conversion with style e or f will be
   performed.
   For the G conversion style conversion with style E or F will be
   performed.
   Let P equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is not
   specified, or 1 if the precision is 0. Then, if a conversion with style
   E would have an exponent of X:
     * if P > X >= -4, the conversion is with style f or F and precision P
       - 1 - X.
     * otherwise, the conversion is with style e or E and precision P - 1.

   Unless alternative representation is requested the trailing zeros are
   removed, also the decimal point character is removed if no fractional
   part is left. For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.
   N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
   n

          Returns the number of characters written so far by this call to
          the function.

   The result is written to the value pointed to by the argument. The
   specification may not contain any flag, field width, or precision.

   The floating-point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or
   infinity. Which one is used is implementation defined.

   Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is
   used is implementation defined.

   The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.

   Even though %c expects int argument, it is safe to pass a char because
   of the integer promotion that takes place when a variadic function is
   called.

   The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character
   types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the header <cinttypes> (although
   PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju, etc).

   The memory-writing conversion specifier %n is a common target of
   security exploits where format strings depend on user input and is not
   supported by the bounds-checked printf_s family of functions.

   There is a sequence point after the action of each conversion
   specifier; this permits storing multiple %n results in the same
   variable or, as an edge case, printing a string modified by an earlier
   %n within the same call.

   If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

Return value

   1,2) Number of characters written if successful or a negative value if
   an error occurred.
   3) Number of characters written if successful (not including the
   terminating null character) or a negative value if an error occurred.
   4) Number of characters that would have been written for a sufficiently
   large buffer if successful (not including the terminating null
   character), or a negative value if an error occurred. Thus, the
   (null-terminated) output has been completely written if and only if the
   returned value is nonnegative and less than buf_size.

Notes

   POSIX specifies that errno is set on error. It also specifies
   additional conversion specifications, most notably support for argument
   reordering (n$ immediately after % indicates n^th argument).

   Calling std::snprintf with zero buf_size and null pointer for buffer is
   useful (when the overhead of double-call is acceptable) to determine
   the necessary buffer size to contain the output:
auto fmt = "sqrt(2) = %f";
int sz = std::snprintf(nullptr, 0, fmt, std::sqrt(2));
std::vector<char> buf(sz + 1); // note +1 for null terminator
std::sprintf(buf.data(), fmt, std::sqrt(2)); // certain to fit
