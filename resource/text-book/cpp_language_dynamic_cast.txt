   Safely converts pointers and references to classes up, down, and
   sideways along the inheritance hierarchy.

Syntax

   dynamic_cast< target-type >( expression )
   target-type - pointer to complete class type, reference to complete
   class type, or pointer to (optionally cv-qualified) void
   expression - lvalue(until C++11)glvalue(since C++11) of a complete
   class type if target-type is a reference, prvalue of a pointer to
   complete class type if target-type is a pointer

   If the cast is successful, dynamic_cast returns a value of type
   target-type. If the cast fails and target-type is a pointer type, it
   returns a null pointer of that type. If the cast fails and target-type
   is a reference type, it throws an exception that matches a handler of
   type std::bad_cast.

Explanation

   For the convenience of description, "expression or the result is a
   reference to T" means that "it is a glvalue of type T", which follows
   the convention of decltype.

   Only the following conversions can be done with dynamic_cast, except
   when such conversions would cast away constness (or volatility).
   1) If the type of expression is exactly target-type or a less
   cv-qualified version of target-type, the result is the value of
   expression, with type target-type. (In other words, dynamic_cast can be
   used to add constness. An implicit conversion and static_cast can
   perform this conversion as well.)
   2) If the value of expression is the null pointer value, the result is
   the null pointer value of type target-type.
   3) If target-type is a pointer or reference to Base, and the type of
   expression is a pointer or reference to Derived, where Base is a
   unique, accessible base class of Derived, the result is a pointer or
   reference to the Base class subobject within the Derived object pointed
   or identified by expression. (Note: an implicit conversion and
   static_cast can perform this conversion as well.)
   4) If expression is a pointer to a polymorphic type, and target-type is
   a pointer to void, the result is a pointer to the most derived object
   pointed or referenced by expression.
   5) If expression is a pointer or reference to a polymorphic type Base,
   and target-type is a pointer or reference to the type Derived a runtime
   check is performed:
   a) The most derived object pointed/identified by expression is
   examined. If, in that object, expression points/refers to a public base
   of Derived, and if only one object of Derived type is derived from the
   subobject pointed/identified by expression, then the result of the cast
   points/refers to that Derived object. (This is known as a "downcast".)
   b) Otherwise, if expression points/refers to a public base of the most
   derived object, and, simultaneously, the most derived object has an
   unambiguous public base class of type Derived, the result of the cast
   points/refers to that Derived (This is known as a "sidecast".)
   c) Otherwise, the runtime check fails. If the dynamic_cast is used on
   pointers, the null pointer value of type target-type is returned. If it
   was used on references, the exception std::bad_cast is thrown.
   6) When dynamic_cast is used in a constructor or a destructor (directly
   or indirectly), and expression refers to the object that's currently
   under construction/destruction, the object is considered to be the most
   derived object. If target-type is not a pointer or reference to the
   constructor's/destructor's own class or one of its bases, the behavior
   is undefined.

   Similar to other cast expressions, the result is:
     * an lvalue if target-type is a reference type
     * an rvalue if target-type is a pointer type

   (until C++11)
     * an lvalue if target-type is an lvalue reference type (expression
       must be an lvalue)
     * an xvalue if target-type is an rvalue reference type (expression
       may be lvalue or rvalue(until C++17)must be a glvalue (prvalues are
       materialized)(since C++17) of a complete class type)
     * a prvalue if target-type is a pointer type

   (since C++11)

Notes

     * A downcast can also be performed with static_cast, which avoids the
       cost of the runtime check, but it's only safe if the program can
       guarantee (through some other logic) that the object pointed to by
       expression is definitely Derived.

     * Some forms of dynamic_cast rely on run-time type identification
       (RTTI), that is, information about each polymorphic class in the
       compiled program. Compilers typically have options to disable the
       inclusion of this information.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>

struct V
{
    virtual void f() {} // must be polymorphic to use runtime-checked dynamic_ca
st
};

struct A : virtual V {};

struct B : virtual V
{
    B(V* v, A* a)
    {
        // casts during construction (see the call in the constructor of D below
)
        dynamic_cast<B*>(v); // well-defined: v of type V*, V base of B, results
 in B*
        dynamic_cast<B*>(a); // undefined behavior: a has type A*, A not a base
of B
    }
};

struct D : A, B
{
    D() : B(static_cast<A*>(this), this) {}
};

struct Base
{
    virtual ~Base() {}
};

struct Derived : Base
{
    virtual void name() {}
};

int main()
{
    D d; // the most derived object
    A& a = d; // upcast, dynamic_cast may be used, but unnecessary

    [[maybe_unused]]
    D& new_d = dynamic_cast<D&>(a); // downcast
    [[maybe_unused]]
    B& new_b = dynamic_cast<B&>(a); // sidecast

    Base* b1 = new Base;
    if (Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b1); d != nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "downcast from b1 to d successful\n";
        d->name(); // safe to call
    }

    Base* b2 = new Derived;
    if (Derived* d = dynamic_cast<Derived*>(b2); d != nullptr)
    {
        std::cout << "downcast from b2 to d successful\n";
        d->name(); // safe to call
    }

    delete b1;
    delete b2;
}

   Output:
downcast from b2 to d successful
