   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >

   concept bool CopyConstructible =
       MoveConstructible<T> &&
       Constructible<T, T&> && ConvertibleTo<T&, T> &&
       Constructible<T, const T&> && ConvertibleTo<const T&, T> &&
       Constructible<T, const T> && ConvertibleTo<const T, T>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept CopyConstructible is satisfied if T is an lvalue reference
   type, or if it is a MoveConstructible object type where an object of
   that type can constructed from a (possibly const) lvalue or const
   rvalue of that type in both direct- and copy-initialization contexts
   with the usual semantics (a copy is constructed with the source
   unchanged).

   More precisely, if T is an object type, then CopyConstructible<T> is
   satisfied only if given
     * v, an lvalue of type (possibly const) T or an rvalue of type const
       T,

   the following are true:
     * After the definition T u = v;, u is equal to v;
     * T{v} is equal to v.
