   locale_type imbue( locale_type loc );
                                        (since C++11)

   Replaces the current locale with loc. The regular expression does not
   match any character sequence after the call.

   Effectively calls traits_i.imbue(loc) where traits_i is a default
   initialized instance of the type Traits stored within the regular
   expression object.

Parameters

   loc - new locale to use

Return value

   The locale before the call to this function. Effectively returns the
   result of expression traits_i.imbue(loc).

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
