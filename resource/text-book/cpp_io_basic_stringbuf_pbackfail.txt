   protected:
   virtual int_type pbackfail( int_type c = Traits::eof() )

   This protected virtual function is called by the public functions
   basic_streambuf::sungetc and basic_streambuf::sputbackc (which, in
   turn, are called by basic_istream::unget and basic_istream::putback).
   1) The caller is requesting that the get area is backed up by one
   character (pbackfail() is called with no arguments or with
   Traits::eof() as the argument)
   a) First, checks if there is a putback position, and if there really
   isn't, fails. (stringbuf has no external character source to re-read)
   b) If the caller was wrong and the putback position is in fact
   available, simply decrements basic_streambuf::gptr(), e.g. by calling
   gbump(-1).
   2) The caller attempts to putback a different character from the one
   retrieved earlier (pbackfail() is called with the character that needs
   to be put back), in which case
   a) First, checks if there is a putback position, and if there isn't,
   fails.
   b) Then checks what character is in the putback position. If the
   character held there is already equal to c, as determined by
   Traits::eq(to_char_type(c), gptr()[-1]), then simply decrements
   basic_streambuf::gptr().
   c) Otherwise, if the buffer is open for reading only, fails.
   d) Otherwise, if the buffer is open for writing (mode &&
   std::ios_base::out is nonzero), then decrements basic_streambuf::gptr()
   and writes c to the location pointed to gptr() after adjustment.

Parameters

   c - the character to put back, or Traits::eof() to indicate that
   backing up of the get area is requested

Return value

   c on success except if c was Traits::eof(), in which case
   Traits::not_eof(c) is returned.

   Traits::eof() on failure.
