   protected:
   virtual void imbue( const std::locale& loc )

   Changes the associated locale so that all characters inserted or
   extracted after this call (and until another call to imbue()) are
   converted using the std::codecvt facet of loc.

   If the old locale's encoding is state-dependent and file is not
   positioned at the beginning, then the new locale must have the same
   std::codecvt facet as the one previously imbued.

Parameters

   loc - the locale to imbue the stream with

Return value

   (none)
