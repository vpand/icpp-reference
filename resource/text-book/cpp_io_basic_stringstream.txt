   Defined in header <sstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>
   > class basic_stringstream
       : public basic_iostream<CharT, Traits>;

   The class template std::basic_stringstream implements input and output
   operations on string based streams. It effectively stores an instance
   of std::basic_string and performs the input and output operations on
   it.

   At the low level, the class essentially wraps a raw string device
   implementation of std::basic_stringbuf into a higher-level interface of
   std::basic_iostream. The complete interface to unique
   std::basic_stringbuf members is provided.
