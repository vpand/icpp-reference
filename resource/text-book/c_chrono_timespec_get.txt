   timespec
   (C11)

   Defined in header <time.h>
   int timespec_get( struct timespec *ts, int base );
   (1)                                               (since C11)
   #define TIME_UTC /* implementation-defined */
   (2)                                               (since C11)
   1) Modifies the timespec object pointed to by ts to hold the current
   calendar time in the time base base.
   2) Expands to a value suitable for use as the base argument of
   timespec_get

   Other macro constants beginning with TIME_ may be provided by the
   implementation to indicate additional time bases

   If base is TIME_UTC, then
     * ts->tv_sec is set to the number of seconds since an implementation
       defined epoch, truncated to a whole value
     * ts->tv_nsec member is set to the integral number of nanoseconds,
       rounded to the resolution of the system clock

Parameters

   ts - pointer to an object of type struct timespec
   base - TIME_UTC or another nonzero integer value indicating the time
   base

Return value

   The value of base if successful, zero otherwise.

Notes

   The POSIX function clock_gettime(CLOCK_REALTIME, ts) may also be used
   to populate a timespec with the time since the Epoch.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void)
{
    struct timespec ts;
    timespec_get(&ts, TIME_UTC);
    char buff[100];
    strftime(buff, sizeof buff, "%D %T", gmtime(&ts.tv_sec));
    printf("Current time: %s.%09ld UTC\n", buff, ts.tv_nsec);
}

   Possible output:
Current time: 02/18/15 14:34:03.048508855 UTC
