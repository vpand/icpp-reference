   Recent milestones: C++20 published, C++23 underway

   C++20 has been published, and work is now underway on C++23.

   Starting in 2012, the committee has transitioned to a "decoupled" model
   where major pieces of work can progress independently from the Standard
   itself and be delivered in "feature branch" TSes. Vendors can choose to
   implement these, and the community can gain experience with the
   std::experimental version of each feature. This lets us learn and
   adjust each feature's design based on experience before it is cast in
   stone when merged into the "trunk" C++ Standard itself. In the
   meantime, the Standard can be delivered on a more regular cadence with
   smaller and more predictable batches of features. This approach also
   helps C++ compilers to track the Standard more closely and add both the
   experimental and the draft-final C++ features in a more consistent
   order. The current schedule is in paper P1000.

   You can also visit open-std.org to get the latest C++ standards
   committee papers. Reading through those proposals, you can track the
   C++ developing trends and know how does a cool idea turned into the
   standard. However, those papers ARE NOT and also SHOULD NOT BE TREATED
   AS the standard documents.
