   (C++11)

   protected:
   virtual int sync()

   If a put area exists (e.g. the file was opened for writing), calls
   overflow() to write all pending output to the file, then flushes the
   file as if by calling std::fflush.

   If a get area exists (e.g. the file was opened for reading), the effect
   is implementation-defined. Typical implementation may empty out the get
   area and move the current file position back by the corresponding
   number of bytes.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   0 in case of success, -1 in case of failure.

Notes

   sync() or its equivalent is implicitly called for output streams by
   close(), seekoff(), and seekpos() and explicitly called by
   std::basic_streambuf::pubsync()
