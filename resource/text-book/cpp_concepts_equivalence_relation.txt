   Defined in header <concepts>
   template< class R, class T, class U >
   concept equivalence_relation = std::relation<R, T, U>;
                                        (since C++20)

   The concept equivalence_relation<R, T, U> specifies that the relation R
   imposes an equivalence relation on its arguments.

Semantic requirements

   A relation r is an equivalence relation if
     * it is reflexive: for all x, r(x, x) is true;
     * it is symmetric: for all a and b, r(a, b) is true if and only if
       r(b, a) is true;
     * it is transitive: r(a, b) && r(b, c) implies r(a, c).

Notes

   The distinction between relation and equivalence_relation is purely
   semantic.
