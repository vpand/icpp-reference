   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T, class U >

   concept bool CommonReference =
       Same<ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>,
   ranges::common_reference_t<U, T>> &&
       ConvertibleTo<T, ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>> &&
       ConvertibleTo<U, ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept CommonReference<T, U> specifies that two types T and U
   share a common reference type (as computed by
   ranges::common_reference_t) to which both can be converted.

   CommonReference<T, U> is satisfied only if, given expressions t and u
   such that decltype((t)) is T and decltype((u)) is U,
     * ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(t) is equal to
       ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(t) if and only if t is an
       equality-preserving expression; and
     * ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(u) is equal to
       ranges::common_reference_t<T, U>(u) if and only if u is an
       equality-preserving expression.

   In other words, the conversion to the common reference type must not
   alter the equality-preservation property of the original expression.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.
