   template< class ForwardIt >
   string_type transform( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last) const;

   Obtains the sort key for the character sequence [first, last), such
   that if a sort key compares less than another sort key with operator<,
   then the character sequence that produced the first sort key comes
   before the character sequence that produced the second sort key, in the
   currently imbued locale's collation order.

   For example, when the regex flag std::regex_constants::collate is set,
   then the sequence [a-b] would match some character c1 if
   traits.transform("a") <= traits.transform(c1) <= traits.transform("b").
   Note that this function takes a character sequence as the argument to
   accommodate to the ranges defined like [[.ae.]-d].

   Standard library specializations of std::regex_traits return
   std::use_facet<std::collate<CharT>>(getloc()).transform(str.data(),
   str.data() + str.length()) for some temporary string str constructed as
   string_type str(first, last).

Parameters

   first, last - a pair of LegacyForwardIterators which determines the
   sequence of characters to compare
   Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

Return value

   The collation key for the character sequence [first, last) in the
   currently imbued locale.
