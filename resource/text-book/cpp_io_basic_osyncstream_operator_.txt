   Move-assigns a synchronized output stream:

   Move-assigns the wrapped std::basic_syncbuf from the corresponding
   member of other (after this move-assignment, other.get_wrapped()
   returns a null pointer and destruction of other produces no output; any
   pending buffered output will be emitted) and move-assigns the base
   std::basic_ostream (this swaps all stream state variables except for
   rdbuf between *this and other)

Parameters

   other - another synchronized output stream to move from

Return value

   *this

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <syncstream>
#include <utility>

int main()
{
    std::osyncstream out(std::cout);
    out << "test\n";
    std::ostringstream str_out;
    std::osyncstream{str_out} = std::move(out); // Note that out is emitted here
    std::cout << "str_out = " << std::quoted(str_out.view()) << '\n';
}

   Output:
test
str_out = ""

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 3867 C++20 the move assignment operator was noexcept, but
   std::basic_syncbuf's move assignment operator is not removed noexcept
