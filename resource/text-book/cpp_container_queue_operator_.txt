   queue& operator=( const queue& other );
   (1) (implicitly declared)
   queue& operator=( queue&& other );
   (2) (since C++11)
   (implicitly declared)

   Replaces the contents of the container adaptor with the contents of
   given argument.
   1) Copy assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the
   contents of other. Effectively calls c = other.c;.
   2) Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other
   using move semantics. Effectively calls c = std::move(other.c);.

Parameters

   other - another container adaptor to be used as source

Return value

   *this

Complexity

   1,2) Equivalent to that of operator= of the underlying container.
