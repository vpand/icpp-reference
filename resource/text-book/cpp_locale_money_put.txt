       class CharT,
       class OutputIt = std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT>
   > class money_put;

   Class std::money_put encapsulates the rules for formatting monetary
   values as strings. The standard I/O manipulator std::put_money uses the
   std::money_put facet of the I/O stream's locale.

   Inheritance diagram

   If a std::money_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by
   the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and
   do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale
   object):
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::money_put<char> creates narrow string representations of monetary
   values
   std::money_put<wchar_t> creates wide string representations of monetary
   values

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every
   specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:
     * CharT is one of
          + char,
          + wchar_t, and
          + any other implementation-defined character container type that
            meets the requirements for a character on which any of the
            iostream components can be instantiated; and
     * OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   char_type   CharT
   string_type std::basic_string<CharT>
   iter_type   OutputIt

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new money_put facet
   (public member function)
   put
   invokes do_put
   (public member function)

Protected member functions

   (destructor)
   destructs a money_put facet
   (protected member function)
   do_put
   [virtual]
   formats a monetary value and writes to output stream
   (virtual protected member function)

Member objects

   static std::locale::id id
   id of the locale
   (public member object)

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>

int main()
{
    // using the I/O manipulator
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << "American locale: "
              << std::showbase << std::put_money(12345678.9) << '\n';

    // using the facet directly
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << "German locale: ";
    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::money_put<char>>(std::cout.getloc());
    f.put({std::cout}, false, std::cout, std::cout.fill(), 12345678.9);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Output:
American locale: $123,456.79
German locale: 123.456,79 EUR

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 427 C++98 money_put was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
   meets the requirements for a character on which
   any of the iostream components can be instantiated only guarantees to
   accept char,
   wchar_t and other implementation-
   defined character types
   LWG 2392 C++98 only character type CharT could be
   guaranteed to be accepted by money_put can guarantee to accept
   implementation-
   defined character container types
