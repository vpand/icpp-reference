   basic_spanbuf() : basic_spanbuf(std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out)
   {}
   (1) (since C++23)
   explicit basic_spanbuf( std::ios_base::openmode which )
       : basic_spanbuf(std::span<CharT>{}, which) {}
   (2) (since C++23)
   explicit basic_spanbuf( std::span<CharT> buf, std::ios_base::openmode
   which =
                               std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );
   (3) (since C++23)
   basic_spanbuf( const basic_spanbuf& ) = delete;
   (4) (since C++23)
   basic_spanbuf( basic_spanbuf&& rhs );
   (5) (since C++23)
   1) Default constructor. Creates a basic_spanbuf that has no underlying
   buffer and is opened for both input and output. The pointers to get and
   put area are set to the null pointer value.
   2) Same as (1), except that the basic_spanbuf is opened in mode
   specified by which.
   3) Creates a basic_spanbuf that manages the underlying buffer
   referenced by buf (or has no underlying buffer if buf is empty) and is
   opened in mode specified by which. The pointers to get and put area are
   set as following, or to the null pointer value if not mentioned in the
   table:
   Set bits in open mode
   (affecting pointers to get area) Return value after setting
   eback() gptr() egptr()
   std::ios_base::in s.data() s.data() s.data() + s.size()
   Set bits in open mode
   (affecting pointers to put area) Return value after setting
   pbase() pptr() epptr()
   std::ios_base::out && !std::ios_base::ate s.data() s.data() s.data() +
   s.size()
   std::ios_base::out && std::ios_base::ate s.data() s.data() + s.size()
   s.data() + s.size()
   4) Copy constructor is deleted. basic_spanbuf is not copyable.
   5) Move constructor. Move-constructs the std::basic_streambuf base
   subobject from that of rhs. The pointers to get and put area, the open
   mode, and the underlying buffer (if any) are identical to those in rhs
   before construction.
   It is implementation-defined whether rhs still holds the underlying
   buffer after the move-construction.

Parameters

   buf - a std::span referencing the underlying buffer
   rhs - another basic_spanbuf
   which - specifies stream open mode. It is bitmask type, the following
   constants are defined:
   Constant          Explanation
   app               seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary            open in binary mode
   in                open for reading
   out               open for writing
   trunc             discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate               seek to the end of stream immediately after open
   noreplace (C++23) open in exclusive mode

Notes

   These constructors are typically called by the constructors of
   std::basic_ispanstream, std::basic_ospanstream, and
   std::basic_spanstream.
