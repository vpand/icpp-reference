   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   unsigned long      strtoul ( const char* str, char** str_end, int base
   );
   (1)
   unsigned long long strtoull( const char* str, char** str_end, int base
   );
   (2) (since C++11)

   Interprets an unsigned integer value in a byte string pointed to by
   str.

   Discards any whitespace characters (as identified by calling
   std::isspace) until the first non-whitespace character is found, then
   takes as many characters as possible to form a valid base-n (where
   n=base) unsigned integer number representation and converts them to an
   integer value. The valid unsigned integer value consists of the
   following parts:
     * (optional) plus or minus sign
     * (optional) prefix (0) indicating octal base (applies only when the
       base is 8 or 0)
     * (optional) prefix (0x or 0X) indicating hexadecimal base (applies
       only when the base is 16 or 0)
     * a sequence of digits

   The set of valid values for base is {0,2,3,...,36}. The set of valid
   digits for base-2 integers is {0,1}, for base-3 integers is {0,1,2},
   and so on. For bases larger than 10, valid digits include alphabetic
   characters, starting from Aa for base-11 integer, to Zz for base-36
   integer. The case of the characters is ignored.

   Additional numeric formats may be accepted by the currently installed C
   locale.

   If the value of base is 0, the numeric base is auto-detected: if the
   prefix is 0, the base is octal, if the prefix is 0x or 0X, the base is
   hexadecimal, otherwise the base is decimal.

   If the minus sign was part of the input sequence, the numeric value
   calculated from the sequence of digits is negated as if by unary minus
   in the result type, which applies unsigned integer wraparound rules.

   The functions sets the pointer pointed to by str_end to point to the
   character past the last character interpreted. If str_end is a null
   pointer, it is ignored.

Parameters

   str - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to be interpreted
   str_end - pointer to a pointer to character, might be set to a position
   past the last character interpreted
   base - base of the interpreted integer value

Return value

   Integer value corresponding to the contents of str on success. If the
   converted value falls out of range of corresponding return type, range
   error occurs (errno is set to ERANGE) and ULONG_MAX or ULLONG_MAX is
   returned. If no conversion can be performed, 0 is returned.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdlib>
#include <errno.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    const char* p = "10 200000000000000000000000000000 30 -40 - 42";
    char* end = nullptr;
    std::cout << "Parsing '" << p << "':\n";
    for (unsigned long i = std::strtoul(p, &end, 10);
        p != end;
        i = std::strtoul(p, &end, 10))
    {
        std::cout << "'" << std::string(p, end - p) << "' -> ";
        p = end;
        if (errno == ERANGE)
        {
            errno = 0;
            std::cout << "range error, got ";
        }
        std::cout << i << '\n';
    }
    std::cout << "After the loop p points to '" << p << "'\n";
}

   Possible output:
Parsing '10 200000000000000000000000000000 30 -40 - 42':
'10' -> 10
' 200000000000000000000000000000' -> range error, got 18446744073709551615
' 30' -> 30
' -40' -> 18446744073709551576
After the loop p points to ' - 42'
