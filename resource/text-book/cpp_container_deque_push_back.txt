   void push_back( const T& value );
   (1)
   void push_back( T&& value );
   (2)                              (since C++11)

   Appends the given element value to the end of the container.
   1) The new element is initialized as a copy of value.
   2) value is moved into the new element.

   All iterators (including the end() iterator) are invalidated. No
   references are invalidated.

Parameters

   value - the value of the element to append
   Type requirements
   -
   T must meet the requirements of CopyInsertable in order to use overload
   (1).
   -
   T must meet the requirements of MoveInsertable in order to use overload
   (2).

Return value

   (none)

Complexity

   Constant.

Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown (which can be due to Allocator::allocate() or
   element copy/move constructor/assignment), this function has no effect
   (strong exception guarantee).

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <deque>

int main()
{
    std::deque<std::string> letters;

    letters.push_back("abc");
    std::string s{"def"};
    letters.push_back(std::move(s));

    std::cout << "std::deque letters holds: ";
    for (auto&& e : letters)
        std::cout << std::quoted(e) << ' ';

    std::cout << "\nMoved-from string s holds: " << std::quoted(s) << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
std::deque letters holds: "abc" "def"
Moved-from string s holds: ""
