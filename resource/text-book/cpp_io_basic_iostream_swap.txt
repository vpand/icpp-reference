   std::basic_iostream
   Member functions
   basic_iostream::basic_iostream
   basic_iostream::~basic_iostream
   Protected member functions
   basic_iostream::operator=
   basic_iostream::swap

   protected:
   void swap( basic_iostream& other );
             (since C++11)

   Exchanges the state with another input/output stream object.
   Effectively calls basic_istream<CharT,Traits>::swap(other).

   This member function is protected: it is called by the swap member
   functions of the derived stream classes std::basic_stringstream and
   std::basic_fstream, which know how to correctly swap the associated
   stream buffers.

Parameters

   other - another stream to exchange the state with

Return value
