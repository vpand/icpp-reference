   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >

   concept bool MoveConstructible =
       Constructible<T, T> && ConvertibleTo<T, T>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept MoveConstructible is satisfied if T is a reference type, or
   if it is an object type where an object of that type can constructed
   from an rvalue of that type in both direct- and copy-initialization
   contexts, with the usual semantics.

   More precisely, if T is an object type, then MoveConstructible<T> is
   satisfied only if given
     * rv, an rvalue of type T, and
     * u2, a distinct object of type T equal to rv,

   the following are true:
     * After the definition T u = rv;, u is equal to u2;
     * T{rv} is equal to u2; and
     * If T is not const-qualified, then rv's resulting state (after the
       definition/expression is evaluated in either bullets above) is
       valid but unspecified; otherwise, it is unchanged.
