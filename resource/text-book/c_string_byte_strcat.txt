   Defined in header <string.h>
   (1)
   char *strcat( char *dest, const char *src );
   (until C99)
   char *strcat( char *restrict dest, const char *restrict src );
   (since C99)
   errno_t strcat_s(char *restrict dest, rsize_t destsz, const char
   *restrict src);
   (2) (since C11)
   1) Appends a copy of the null-terminated byte string pointed to by src
   to the end of the null-terminated byte string pointed to by dest. The
   character src[0] replaces the null terminator at the end of dest. The
   resulting byte string is null-terminated.
   The behavior is undefined if the destination array is not large enough
   for the contents of both src and dest and the terminating null
   character. The behavior is undefined if the strings overlap. The
   behavior is undefined if either dest or src is not a pointer to a
   null-terminated byte string.
   2) Same as (1), except that it may clobber the rest of the destination
   array (from the last character written to destsz) with unspecified
   values and that the following errors are detected at runtime and call
   the currently installed constraint handler function:

          + src or dest is a null pointer
          + destsz is zero or greater than RSIZE_MAX
          + there is no null terminator in the first destsz bytes of dest
          + truncation would occur (the available space at the end of dest
            would not fit every character, including the null terminator,
            of src)
          + overlap would occur between the source and the destination
            strings

   The behavior is undefined if the size of the character array pointed to
   by dest < strlen(dest)+strlen(src)+1 <= destsz; in other words, an
   erroneous value of destsz does not expose the impending buffer
   overflow.

          As with all bounds-checked functions, strcat_s only guaranteed
          to be available if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the
          implementation and if the user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to
          the integer constant 1 before including <string.h>.

Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to append to
   src - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to copy from
   destsz - maximum number of characters to write, typically the size of
   the destination buffer

Return value

   1) returns a copy of dest
   2) returns zero on success, returns non-zero on error. Also, on error,
   writes zero to dest[0] (unless dest is a null pointer or destsz is zero
   or greater than RSIZE_MAX).

Notes

   Because strcat needs to seek to the end of dest on each call, it is
   inefficient to concatenate many strings into one using strcat.

   strcat_s is allowed to clobber the destination array from the last
   character written up to destsz in order to improve efficiency: it may
   copy in multibyte blocks and then check for null bytes.

   The function strcat_s is similar to the BSD function strlcat, except
   that
     * strlcat truncates the source string to fit in the destination
     * strlcat does not perform all the runtime checks that strcat_s does
     * strlcat does not make failures obvious by setting the destination
       to a null string or calling a handler if the call fails.

   Although strcat_s prohibits truncation due to potential security risks,
   it's possible to truncate a string using bounds-checked strncat_s
   instead.

Example

   Run this code
#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    char str[50] = "Hello ";
    char str2[50] = "World!";
    strcat(str, str2);
    strcat(str, " ...");
    strcat(str, " Goodbye World!");
    puts(str);

#ifdef __STDC_LIB_EXT1__
    set_constraint_handler_s(ignore_handler_s);
    int r = strcat_s(str, sizeof str, " ... ");
    printf("str = \"%s\", r = %d\n", str, r);
    r = strcat_s(str, sizeof str, " and this is too much");
    printf("str = \"%s\", r = %d\n", str, r);
#endif
}

   Possible output:
Hello World! ... Goodbye World!
str = "Hello World! ... Goodbye World! ... ", r = 0
str = "", r = 22
