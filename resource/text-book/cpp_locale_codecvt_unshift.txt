   Defined in header <locale>
   public:

   result unshift( StateT& state, ExternT* to, ExternT* to_end,
                   ExternT*& to_next ) const;
   (1)
   protected:

   virtual result do_unshift( StateT& state, ExternT* to, ExternT* to_end,
                              ExternT*& to_next ) const;
   (2)
   1) Public member function, calls the member function do_unshift of the
   most derived class.
   2) If the encoding represented by this codecvt facet is
   state-dependent, and state represents a conversion state that is not
   the initial shift state, writes the characters necessary to return to
   the initial shift state. The characters are written to a character
   array whose first element is pointed to by to. No more than to_end - to
   characters are written. The parameter to_next is updated to point one
   past the last character written.

Return value

   A value of type std::codecvt_base::result, indicating the success
   status as follows:
   ok all necessary characters were written. state now represents initial
   shift state
   partial not enough space in the output buffer. to_next == to_end
   error an unspecified error has occurred
   noconv the encoding is not state-dependent, no termination sequence
   necessary

Notes

   This function is called by std::basic_filebuf::close() and in other
   situations when finalizing a state-dependent multibyte character
   sequence.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 305 C++98 std::codecvt<wchar_t, char, std::mbstate_t>::do_unshift
   was required not to write any character not required
   LWG 380 C++98 the meaning of returning partial was 'more characters
   need to
   be supplied to complete termination', but no character is supplied
   corrected to indicating
   insufficient buffer space
   LWG 381 C++98 state was not required to be valid, and
   error is returned if state is invalid state is required to be valid,
   and
   returning error indicates an error
   LWG 664 C++98 std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t>::do_unshift
   was required not to write any character not required
   LWG 665 C++98 std::codecvt<char, char, std::mbstate_t>::do_unshift
   was required to return noconv not required
