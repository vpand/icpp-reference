   std::basic_string_view<CharT, Traits> view() const noexcept;
                                                               (since C++20)

   Obtains a std::basic_string_view over the underlying string object.
   Equivalent to return rdbuf()->view();.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   A std::basic_string_view over the underlying string object.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    // input/output stream
    std::stringstream buf1;
    buf1 << 69;
    int n = 0;
    buf1 >> n;
    std::cout << "1) buf1 = [" << buf1.view() << "], n = " << n << '\n';

    // output stream in append mode
    std::ostringstream buf2("test", std::ios_base::ate);
    buf2 << '1';
    std::cout << "2) buf2 = [" << buf2.view() << "]\n";

    // input stream
    std::istringstream inbuf("-42");
    inbuf >> n;
    std::cout << "3) inbuf = [" << inbuf.view() << "], n = " << n << '\n';
}

   Output:
1) buf1 = [69], n = 69
2) buf2 = [test1]
3) inbuf = [-42], n = -42
