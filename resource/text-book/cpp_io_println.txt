   Defined in header <print>
   template< class... Args >
   void println( std::format_string<Args...> fmt, Args&&... args );
   (1)                               (since C++23)
   template< class... Args >

   void println( std::FILE* stream,
                 std::format_string<Args...> fmt, Args&&... args );
   (2)                               (since C++23)
   void println();
   (3)                               (since C++26)
   void println( std::FILE* stream );
   (4)                               (since C++26)

   Format args according to the format string fmt with appended '\n'
   (which means that each output ends with a new-line), and print the
   result to a stream.
   1) Equivalent to std::println(stdout, fmt,
   std::forward<Args>(args)...).
   2) Equivalent to std::print(stream,
   std::runtime_format(std::string(fmt.get()) + '\n'),
              std::forward<Args>(args)...).
   3) Equivalent to std::println(stdout).
   4) Equivalent to std::print(stream, "\n").

   The behavior is undefined if std::formatter<Ti, char> does not meet the
   BasicFormatter requirements for any Ti in Args (as required by
   std::make_format_args).

Parameters

   stream - output file stream to write to
   fmt -
   an object that represents the format string. The format string consists
   of
     * ordinary characters (except { and }), which are copied unchanged to
       the output,
     * escape sequences {{ and }}, which are replaced with { and }
       respectively in the output, and
     * replacement fields.

   Each replacement field has the following format:
   { arg-id (optional) }               (1)
   { arg-id (optional) : format-spec } (2)
   1) replacement field without a format specification
   2) replacement field with a format specification
   arg-id - specifies the index of the argument in args whose value is to
   be used for formatting; if it is omitted, the arguments are used in
   order.

   The arg-id¿s in a format string must all be present or all be omitted.
   Mixing manual and automatic indexing is an error.
   format-spec - the format specification defined by the std::formatter
   specialization for the corresponding argument. Cannot start with }.

     * For basic types and standard string types, the format specification
       is interpreted as standard format specification.
     * For chrono types, the format specification is interpreted as chrono
       format specification.

     * For range types, the format specification is interpreted as range
       format specification.
     * For std::pair and std::tuple, the format specification is
       interpreted as tuple format specification.
     * For std::thread::id and std::stacktrace_entry, see thread id format
       specification and stacktrace entry format specification.
     * For std::basic_stacktrace, no format specifier is allowed.

   (since C++23)
     * For std::filesystem::path, see path format specification.

   (since C++26)
     * For other formattable types, the format specification is determined
       by user-defined formatter specializations.

   args... - arguments to be formatted

Exceptions

     * std::bad_alloc on allocation failure.
     * std::system_error, if writing to the stream fails.
     * Propagates any exception thrown by used formatters, e.g.
       std::format_error.

Notes

   Although overloads (3,4) are added in C++26, all known implementations
   make them available in C++23 mode.
   Feature-test macro Value Std Feature
   __cpp_lib_print 202207L (C++23) Formatted output
   202403L (C++26)
   (DR23) Formatted output with stream locking
   __cpp_lib_format 202207L (C++23) Exposing std::basic_format_string

Example

   Run this code
#include <print>

int main()
{
    // Each call to std::println ends with new-line
    std::println("Please"); // overload (1)
    std::println("enter"); // (1)

    std::print("pass");
    std::print("word");

    std::println(); // (3); valid since C++26; same effect as std::print("\n");
}

   Output:
Please
