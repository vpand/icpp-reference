   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   void* bsearch( const void* key, const void* ptr, std::size_t count,

                  std::size_t size, /* c-compare-pred */* comp );
   void* bsearch( const void* key, const void* ptr, std::size_t count,
                  std::size_t size, /* compare-pred */* comp );
   (1)
   extern "C" using /* c-compare-pred */ = int(const void*, const void*);
   extern "C++" using /* compare-pred */ = int(const void*, const void*);
   (2) (exposition only*)

   Finds an element equal to element pointed to by key in an array pointed
   to by ptr. The array contains count elements of size bytes each and
   must be partitioned with respect to the object pointed to by key, that
   is, all the elements that compare less than must appear before all the
   elements that compare equal to, and those must appear before all the
   elements that compare greater than the key object. A fully sorted array
   satisfies these requirements. The elements are compared using function
   pointed to by comp.

   The behavior is undefined if the array is not already partitioned in
   ascending order with respect to key, according to the same criterion
   that comp uses.

   If the array contains several elements that comp would indicate as
   equal to the element searched for, then it is unspecified which element
   the function will return as the result.

Parameters

   key   - pointer to the element to search for
   ptr   - pointer to the array to examine
   count - number of element in the array
   size  - size of each element in the array in bytes
   comp  - comparison function which returns a negative integer value if
   the first argument is less than the second, a positive integer value if
   the first argument is greater than the second and zero if the arguments
   are equivalent.key is passed as the first argument, an element from the
   array as the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

    int cmp(const void *a, const void *b);

   The function must not modify the objects passed to it and must return
   consistent results when called for the same objects, regardless of
   their positions in the array.

Return value

   Pointer to the found element or null pointer if the element has not
   been found.

Notes

   Despite the name, neither C nor POSIX standards require this function
   to be implemented using binary search or make any complexity
   guarantees.

   The two overloads provided by the C++ standard library are distinct
   because the types of the parameter comp are distinct (language linkage
   is part of its type).

Example

   Run this code
#include <array>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>

template<typename T>
int compare(const void *a, const void *b)
{
    const auto &arg1 = *(static_cast<const T*>(a));
    const auto &arg2 = *(static_cast<const T*>(b));
    const auto cmp = arg1 <=> arg2;
    return cmp < 0 ? -1
        :  cmp > 0 ? +1
        :  0;
}

int main()
{
    std::array arr{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

    for (const int key : {4, 8, 9})
    {
        const int* p = static_cast<int*>(
            std::bsearch(&key,
                arr.data(),
                arr.size(),
                sizeof(decltype(arr)::value_type),
                compare<int>));

        std::cout << "value " << key;
        if (p)
            std::cout << " found at position " << (p - arr.data()) << '\n'
        else
            std::cout << " not found\n";
    }
}

   Output:
value 4 found at position 3
value 8 found at position 7
value 9 not found
