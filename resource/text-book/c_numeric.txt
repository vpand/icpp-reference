   Numerics
   Common mathematical functions
   Floating-point environment (C99)
   Pseudo-random number generation
   Complex number arithmetic (C99)
   Type-generic math (C99)

   The C numerics library includes common mathematical functions and
   types, as well as support for random number generation.

Common mathematical functions

   The header math.h provides standard C library mathematical functions
   such as fabs, sqrt, and sin.

Floating-point environment

   The header fenv.h defines flags and functions related to exceptional
   floating-point state, such as overflow and division by zero.

Pseudo-random number generation

   The header stdlib.h also includes C-style random number generation via
   srand and rand.

Complex number arithmetic

   The header complex.h provides types and functions about complex
   numbers.

Type-generic math

   The header tgmath.h provides some macros for a function which names
   XXX:
     * real function:

          + float variant XXXf
          + double variant XXX
          + long double variant XXXl

     * complex function:

          + float variant cXXXf
          + double variant cXXX
          + long double variant cXXXl
