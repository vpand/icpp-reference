   std::experimental::ostream_joiner is a single-pass LegacyOutputIterator
   that writes successive objects into the std::basic_ostream object for
   which it was constructed, using operator<<, separated by a delimiter.
   The delimiter is written to the output stream between every two objects
   that are written. The write operation is performed when the iterator
   (whether dereferenced or not) is assigned to. Incrementing the
   ostream_joiner is a no-op.

   In a typical implementation, the only data members of ostream_joiner
   are a pointer to the associated std::basic_ostream, the delimiter, and
   a bool member that indicates whether the next write is for the first
   element in the sequence.

   Compared to std::ostream_iterator, ostream_joiner prints the delimiter
   sequence one fewer time, and is not templated on the type of the object
   to be printed.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new ostream_joiner
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   (implicitly declared)
   destructs an ostream_joiner
   (public member function)
   operator=
   writes an object to the associated output sequence
   (public member function)
   operator*
   no-op
   (public member function)
   operator++operator++(int)
   no-op
   (public member function)

Non-member functions

   make_ostream_joiner
   creates an ostream_joiner object, deducing the template's type
   arguments from the function arguments
   (function template)

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <experimental/iterator>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>

int main()
{
    int i[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    std::copy(std::begin(i),
              std::end(i),
              std::experimental::make_ostream_joiner(std::cout, ", "));
}

   Output:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
