   operator>>(std::basic_istream)

   protected:
   void swap( basic_istream& rhs );
             (since C++11)

   Calls basic_ios::swap(rhs) to swap all data members of the base class
   except for rdbuf(), and swaps the values of the gcount() counters
   between *this and rhs. This swap function is protected: it is called by
   the swap functions of the swappable input stream classes
   std::basic_ifstream and std::basic_istringstream, which know how to
   correctly swap the associated streambuffers.

Parameters

   rhs - different basic_istream object of the same type to swap with

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <utility>

int main()
{
    std::istringstream s1("hello");
    std::istringstream s2("bye");

    s1.swap(s2); // OK, istringstream has a public swap()
    std::swap(s1, s2); // OK, calls s1.swap(s2)
//  std::cin.swap(s2); // ERROR: swap is a protected member

    std::cout << s1.rdbuf() << '\n';
}

   Output:
hello
