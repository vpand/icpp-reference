   Defined in header <cstdio>
   std::size_t fwrite( const void* buffer, std::size_t size, std::size_t
   count, std::FILE* stream );

   Writes up to count binary objects from the given array buffer to the
   output stream stream. The objects are written as if by reinterpreting
   each object as an array of unsigned char and calling std::fputc size
   times for each object to write those unsigned chars into stream, in
   order. The file position indicator for the stream is advanced by the
   number of characters written.

   If the objects are not TriviallyCopyable, the behavior is undefined.

   If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator
   for the stream is indeterminate.

Parameters

   buffer - pointer to the first object in the array to be written
   size   - size of each object
   count  - the number of the objects to be written
   stream - output file stream to write to

Return value

   Number of objects written successfully, which may be less than count if
   an error occurred.

   If size or count is zero, fwrite returns zero and performs no other
   action.

Example

   Run this code
#include <array>
#include <cstdio>
#include <vector>

int main ()
{
    // write buffer to file
    if (std::FILE* f1 = std::fopen("file.bin", "wb"))
    {
        std::array<int, 3> v = {42, -1, 7}; // underlying storage of std::array
is an array
        std::fwrite(v.data(), sizeof v[0], v.size(), f1);
        std::fclose(f1);
    }

    // read the same data and print it to the standard output
    if (std::FILE* f2 = std::fopen("file.bin", "rb"))
    {
        std::vector<int> rbuf(10); // underlying storage of std::vector is also
an array
        std::size_t sz = std::fread(rbuf.data(), sizeof rbuf[0], rbuf.size(), f2
);
        std::fclose(f2);
        for (std::size_t n = 0; n < sz; ++n)
            std::printf("%d\n", rbuf[n]);
    }
}

   Output:
42
-1
7
