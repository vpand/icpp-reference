   std::span<CharT> span() const noexcept;
   (1)                                      (since C++23)
   void span( std::span<CharT> s ) noexcept;
   (2)                                      (since C++23)
   1) Gets a span referencing the written area if std::ios_base::out is
   set in the open mode, or a span referencing the underlying buffer
   otherwise.
   2) Makes the basic_spanbuf perform I/O on the buffer referenced by s.
   Sets pointers to get area, put area, or both.
   Set bits in open mode
   (affecting pointers to get area) Return value after setting
   eback() gptr() egptr()
   std::ios_base::in s.data() s.data() s.data() + s.size()
   Set bits in open mode
   (affecting pointers to put area) Return value after setting
   pbase() pptr() epptr()
   std::ios_base::out && !std::ios_base::ate s.data() s.data() s.data() +
   s.size()
   std::ios_base::out && std::ios_base::ate s.data() s.data() + s.size()
   s.data() + s.size()

Parameters

   s - a std::span that references the user-provided buffer

Return value

   1) std::span<CharT>(pbase(), pptr()) if std::ios_base::out is set in
   the open mode, or a std::span<CharT> that references the whole
   underlying buffer otherwise.
   2) (none)
