   A constructor that is not declared with the specifier explicit and
   which can be called with a single parameter(until C++11) is called a
   converting constructor.

   Unlike explicit constructors, which are only considered during direct
   initialization (which includes explicit conversions such as
   static_cast), converting constructors are also considered during copy
   initialization, as part of user-defined conversion sequence.

   It is said that a converting constructor specifies an implicit
   conversion from the types of its arguments (if any) to the type of its
   class. Note that non-explicit user-defined conversion function also
   specifies an implicit conversion.

   Implicitly-declared and user-defined non-explicit copy constructors and
   move constructors are converting constructors.

Example

   Run this code
struct A
{
    A() { }         // converting constructor (since C++11)
    A(int) { }      // converting constructor
    A(int, int) { } // converting constructor (since C++11)
};

struct B
{
    explicit B() { }
    explicit B(int) { }
    explicit B(int, int) { }
};

int main()
{
    A a1 = 1;      // OK: copy-initialization selects A::A(int)
    A a2(2);       // OK: direct-initialization selects A::A(int)
    A a3{4, 5};    // OK: direct-list-initialization selects A::A(int, int)
    A a4 = {4, 5}; // OK: copy-list-initialization selects A::A(int, int)
    A a5 = (A)1;   // OK: explicit cast performs static_cast, direct-initializat
ion

//  B b1 = 1;      // error: copy-initialization does not consider B::B(int)
    B b2(2);       // OK: direct-initialization selects B::B(int)
    B b3{4, 5};    // OK: direct-list-initialization selects B::B(int, int)
//  B b4 = {4, 5}; // error: copy-list-initialization selected an explicit const
ructor
                   //        B::B(int, int)
    B b5 = (B)1;   // OK: explicit cast performs static_cast, direct-initializat
ion
    B b6;          // OK, default-initialization
    B b7{};        // OK, direct-list-initialization
//  B b8 = {};     // error: copy-list-initialization selected an explicit const
ructor
                   //        B::B()

    [](...){}(a1, a4, a4, a5, b5); // may suppress "unused variable" warnings
}
