   Move assigns the string stream other to *this, effectively
   move-assigning both the std::basic_istream base class and the
   associated std::basic_stringbuf.

   Note that the base class move assignment swaps all stream state
   variables (except for rdbuf) between *this and other.

Parameters

   other - string stream to move from

Return value

   *this
