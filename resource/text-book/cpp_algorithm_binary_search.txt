   template< class ForwardIt, class T = typename std::iterator_traits

                                            <ForwardIt>::value_type,

   constexpr bool binary_search( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,
                                 const T& value, Compare comp );
   (since C++26)

   Checks if an element equivalent to value appears within the partitioned
   range [first, last).
   1) The equivalence is checked using operator<:

   If !bool(*iter < value) && !bool(value < *iter) is true for some
   iterator iter in [first, last), returns true. Otherwise returns false.

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * For any element elem of [first, last), bool(elem < value) does not
       imply !bool(value < elem).
     * The elements elem of [first, last) are not partitioned with respect
       to expressions bool(elem < value) and !bool(value < elem).

   (until C++20)

   Equivalent to std::binary_search(first, last, value, std::less{}).
   (since C++20)
   2) The equivalence is checked using comp:
   If !bool(comp(*iter, value)) && !bool(comp(value, *iter)) is true for
   some iterator iter in [first, last), returns true. Otherwise returns
   false.
   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * For any element elem of [first, last), bool(comp(elem, value)) does
       not imply !bool(comp(value, elem)).
     * The elements elem of [first, last) are not partitioned with respect
       to expressions bool(comp(elem, value)) and !bool(comp(value,
       elem)).

Parameters

   first, last - the partitioned range of elements to examine
   value - value to compare the elements to
   comp - binary predicate which returns true if the first argument is
   ordered before the second.

   The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the
   following:

    bool pred(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

   While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must
   not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all
   values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value
   category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a
   move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type T can be
   implicitly converted to both Type1 and Type2, and an object of type
   ForwardIt can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both
   Type1 and Type2.
   Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of BinaryPredicate. It is not
   required to satisfy Compare.

Return value

   true if an element equivalent to value is found, false otherwise.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):
   1) At most \(\scriptsize \log_{2}(N)+O(1)\)log
   2(N)+O(1) comparisons with value using operator<(until
   C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   2) At most \(\scriptsize \log_{2}(N)+O(1)\)log
   2(N)+O(1) applications of the comparator comp.

   However, if ForwardIt is not a LegacyRandomAccessIterator, the number
   of iterator increments is linear in \(\scriptsize N\)N.

Notes

   Although std::binary_search only requires [first, last) to be
   partitioned, this algorithm is usually used in the case where
   [first, last) is sorted, so that the binary search is valid for any
   value.

   std::binary_search only checks whether an equivalent element exists. To
   obtain an iterator to that element (if exists), std::lower_bound should
   be used instead.

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <complex>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    const auto haystack = {1, 3, 4, 5, 9};

    for (const auto needle : {1, 2, 3})
    {
        std::cout << "Searching for " << needle << '\n';
        if (std::binary_search(haystack.begin(), haystack.end(), needle))
            std::cout << "Found " << needle << '\n';
        else
            std::cout << "No dice!\n";
    }

    using CD = std::complex<double>;
    std::vector<CD> nums{{1, 1}, {2, 3}, {4, 2}, {4, 3}};
    auto cmpz = [](CD x, CD y){ return abs(x) < abs(y); };
    #ifdef __cpp_lib_algorithm_default_value_type
        assert(std::binary_search(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend(), {4, 2}, cmpz));
    #else
        assert(std::binary_search(nums.cbegin(), nums.cend(), CD{4, 2}, cmpz));
    #endif
}

   Output:
Searching for 1
Found 1
Searching for 2
no dice!
Searching for 3
Found 3
