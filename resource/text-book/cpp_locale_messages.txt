   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class CharT
   > class messages;

   Class template std::messages is a standard locale facet that
   encapsulates retrieval of strings from message catalogs, such as the
   ones provided by GNU gettext or by POSIX catgets.

   The source of the messages is implementation-defined.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale
   object):
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::messages<char>    accesses narrow string message catalog
   std::messages<wchar_t> accesses wide string message catalog
