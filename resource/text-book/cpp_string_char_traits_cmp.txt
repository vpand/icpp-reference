   static bool eq( char_type a, char_type b );
   (1) (constexpr since C++11)
   (noexcept since C++11)
   static bool lt( char_type a, char_type b );

   Compares two characters.
   1) Compares a and b for equality, behaves identically to
     * static_cast<unsigned char>(a) == static_cast<unsigned char>(b), if
       char_type is char,
     * a == b otherwise.

   2) Compares a and b in such a way that they are totally ordered,
   behaves identically to
     * static_cast<unsigned char>(a) < static_cast<unsigned char>(b), if
       char_type is char,
     * a < b otherwise.

   See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for
   X::eq and X::lt.

Parameters

   a, b - character values to compare

Return value

   1) true if a and b are equal, false otherwise.
   2) true if a is less than b, false otherwise.

Complexity

   Constant.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 467 C++98 for std::char_traits<char>, the semantics of eq() and
   lt()
   are the same as the built-in == and < on char respectively^[1] changed
   to built-in == and
   < on unsigned char
    1. ^| Most implementations call std::memcmp() for efficiency, which
       interprets the data as arrays of unsigned char. If char is signed
       on such implementations, std::char_traits<char> fails to satisfy
       the requirements of CharTraits.
