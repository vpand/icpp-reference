   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T, class U >

   concept bool Assignable =
       std::is_lvalue_reference<T>::value &&
       CommonReference<
           const std::remove_reference_t<T>&,
           const std::remove_reference_t<U>&> &&
       requires(T t, U&& u) {
           { t = std::forward<U>(u) } -> Same<T>&&;
       };
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept Assignable<T, U> specifies that an expression of the type
   and value category specified by U can be assigned to an lvalue
   expression whose type is specified by T.

   Given
     * t, an lvalue of type std::remove_reference_t<T> that refers to an
       object o,
     * u, an expression such that decltype((u)) is U,
     * u2, a distinct object that is equal to u,

   Assignable<T, U> is satisfied only if
     * std::addressof(t = u) == std::addressof(o) (i.e., the assignment
       expression yields an lvalue referring to the left operand);
     * After evaluating t = u:
          + t is equal to u2, unless u is a non-const xvalue that refers
            to o (i.e., the assignment is a self-move-assignment),
          + if u is a glvalue:
               o If it is a non-const xvalue, the object to which it
                 refers is in a valid but unspecified state;
               o Otherwise, the object it refers to is not modified;

   There need not be any subsumption relationship between Assignable<T, U>
   and std::is_lvalue_reference<T>::value.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.

Notes

   A deduction constraint of the form { expression } -> Same<T>&&
   effectively requires decltype((expression))&& to be the exact same type
   as T&&. This constrains both the expression's type and its value
   category.

   Assignment need not be a total function. In particular, if assigning to
   some object x can cause some other object y to be modified, then x = y
   is likely not in the domain of =. This typically happens if the right
   operand is owned directly or indirectly by the left operand (e.g., with
   smart pointers to nodes in a node-based data structure, or with
   something like std::vector<std::any>).
