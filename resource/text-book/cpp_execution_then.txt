   Eager execution

   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto then(

       execution::sender auto input,
       std::invocable<values-sent-by(input)...> function
   );
                                (since C++26)

Parameters

   input - sender which once executed sends the values upon which the
   function executes
   function - invocable to be called by the new sender chained to the
   input sender

Return value

   Returns a sender describing the task graph described by the input
   sender, with an added node of invoking the provided function with the
   values sent by the input sender as arguments.

   then is guaranteed to not begin executing function until the returned
   sender is started.

Example

   Possible usage of execution::then.
execution::sender auto input = get_input();
execution::sender auto snd = execution::then(input, [](auto... args)
{
    std::print(args...);
});
// snd describes the work described by pred
// followed by printing all of the values sent by pred
