   Defined in header <filesystem>
   class directory_iterator;
                                 (since C++17)

   directory_iterator is a LegacyInputIterator that iterates over the
   directory_entry elements of a directory (but does not visit the
   subdirectories). The iteration order is unspecified, except that each
   directory entry is visited only once. The special pathnames dot and
   dot-dot are skipped.

   If the directory_iterator reports an error or is advanced past the last
   directory entry, it becomes equal to the default-constructed iterator,
   also known as the end iterator. Two end iterators are always equal,
   dereferencing or incrementing the end iterator is undefined behavior.

   If a file or a directory is deleted or added to the directory tree
   after the directory iterator has been created, it is unspecified
   whether the change would be observed through the iterator.

Member types

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a directory iterator
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   default destructor
   (public member function)
   operator=
   assigns contents
   (public member function)
   operator*operator->
   accesses the pointed-to entry
   (public member function)
   incrementoperator++
   advances to the next entry
   (public member function)

Non-member functions

   begin(std::filesystem::directory_iterator)end(std::filesystem::director
   y_iterator)
   (C++17)
   range-based for loop support
   (function)

   Additionally, operator== and operator!= are(until C++20)operator==
   is(since C++20) provided as required by LegacyInputIterator.

   It is unspecified whether operator!= is provided because it can be
   synthesized from operator==, and(since C++20) whether an equality
   operator is a member or non-member.

Helper templates

   namespace std::ranges {

   template<>
   inline constexpr bool
       enable_borrowed_range<std::filesystem::directory_iterator> = true;
   }
                          (since C++20)
   namespace std::ranges {

   template<>
   inline constexpr bool enable_view<std::filesystem::directory_iterator>
   = true;
   }
                          (since C++20)

   These specializations for directory_iterator make it a borrowed_range
   and a view.

Notes

   Many low-level OS APIs for directory traversal retrieve file attributes
   along with the next directory entry. The constructors and the non-const
   member functions of std::filesystem::directory_iterator store these
   attributes, if any, in the pointed-to std::filesystem::directory_entry
   without calling directory_entry::refresh, which makes it possible to
   examine the attributes of the directory entries as they are being
   iterated over, without making additional system calls.

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const std::filesystem::path sandbox{"sandbox"};
    std::filesystem::create_directories(sandbox/"dir1"/"dir2");
    std::ofstream{sandbox/"file1.txt"};
    std::ofstream{sandbox/"file2.txt"};

    std::cout << "directory_iterator:\n";
    // directory_iterator can be iterated using a range-for loop
    for (auto const& dir_entry : std::filesystem::directory_iterator{sandbox})
        std::cout << dir_entry.path() << '\n';

    std::cout << "\ndirectory_iterator as a range:\n";
    // directory_iterator behaves as a range in other ways, too
    std::ranges::for_each(
        std::filesystem::directory_iterator{sandbox},
        [](const auto& dir_entry) { std::cout << dir_entry << '\n'; });

    std::cout << "\nrecursive_directory_iterator:\n";
    for (auto const& dir_entry : std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator{s
andbox})
        std::cout << dir_entry << '\n';

    // delete the sandbox dir and all contents within it, including subdirs
    std::filesystem::remove_all(sandbox);
}

   Possible output:
directory_iterator:
"sandbox/file2.txt"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/dir1"

directory_iterator as a range:
"sandbox/file2.txt"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/dir1"

recursive_directory_iterator:
"sandbox/file2.txt"
"sandbox/file1.txt"
"sandbox/dir1"
"sandbox/dir1/dir2"
