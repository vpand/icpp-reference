   int pubsync();
   (1)
   protected:
   virtual int sync();
   (2)

   Synchronizes the controlled character sequence (the buffers) with the
   associated character sequence.

   1) Calls sync() of the most derived class

   2) The base class version of this function has no effect. The derived
   classes may override this function to allow synchronizing the
   underlying device with the buffers.

   For output streams, this typically results in writing the contents of
   the put area into the associated sequence, i.e. flushing of the output
   buffer. For input streams, this typically empties the get area and
   forces a re-read from the associated sequence to pick up recent
   changes. The default behavior (found, for example, in
   std::basic_stringbuf), is to do nothing.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   1) The return value of sync().

   2) Returns 0 on success, -1 otherwise. The base class version returns
   0.
