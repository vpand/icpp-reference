   swap(std::basic_ipanstream)
   (C++23)

   void swap( basic_ispanstream& other );
                                         (since C++23)

   Exchanges the state of the stream with those of other.

   This is done by calling std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>::swap(other)
   and swapping the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf objects (accessible through
   *rdbuf()).

Parameters

   other - stream to exchange the state with

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
