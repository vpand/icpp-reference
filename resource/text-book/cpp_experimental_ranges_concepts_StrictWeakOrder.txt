   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class R, class T, class U >
   concept bool StrictWeakOrder = Relation<R, T, U>;
   (1)                                             (ranges TS)

   The concept StrictWeakOrder<R, T, U> specifies that the Relation R
   imposes a strict weak ordering on its arguments. A relation r is a
   strict weak ordering if
     * it is irreflexive: for all x, r(x, x) is false;
     * it is transitive: for all a, b and c, if r(a, b) and r(b, c) are
       both true then r(a, c) is true;
     * let e(a, b) be !r(a, b) && !r(b, a), then e is transitive: e(a, b)
       && e(b, c) implies e(a, c).

   Under these conditions, it can be shown that e is an equivalence
   relation, and r induces a strict total ordering on the equivalence
   classes determined by e.

Notes

   The distinction between Relation and StrictWeakOrder is purely
   semantic.
