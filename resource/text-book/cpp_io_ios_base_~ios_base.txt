   virtual ~ios_base();

   Destroys the ios_base object.

   Before any of the member functions would yield undefined results, calls
   callbacks, registered by register_callback() passing erase_event as
   parameter. Then, deallocates any memory obtained.

   No operations on rdbuf are performed, it is not destroyed.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 3434 C++98 the destructor was not required to reclaim memory for
   iarray and parray required
