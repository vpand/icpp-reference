   basic_spanbuf& operator=( basic_spanbuf&& rhs );
   (1)                                                      (since C++23)
   basic_spanbuf& operator( const basic_spanbuf& ) = delete;
   (2)                                                      (since C++23)
   1) Move assignment operator. Equivalent to auto tmp{std::move(rhs)};
   this->swap(tmp); return *this;. After move assignment, *this holds the
   state rhs held before move assignment. It is implementation-defined
   whether rhs still hold the underlying buffer after move assignment.
   2) The copy assignment operator is deleted; basic_spanbuf is not
   CopyAssignable.

Parameters

   rhs - another basic_spanbuf that will be moved from

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
