   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class ForwardIt >
   ForwardIt adjacent_find( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last );
   (1) (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt >

   ForwardIt adjacent_find( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                            ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last );
   (2) (since C++17)
   template< class ForwardIt, class BinaryPred >

   ForwardIt adjacent_find( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,
                            BinaryPred p );
   (3) (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt, class BinaryPred >

   ForwardIt adjacent_find( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                            ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,
                            BinaryPred p );
   (4) (since C++17)

   Searches the range [first, last) for two consecutive equal elements.
   1) Elements are compared using operator==.
   3) Elements are compared using the given binary predicate p.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to examine
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   p - binary predicate which returns true if the elements should be
   treated as equal.

   The signature of the predicate function should be equivalent to the
   following:

    bool pred(const Type1 &a, const Type2 &b);

   While the signature does not need to have const &, the function must
   not modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all
   values of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value
   category (thus, Type1 & is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a
   move is equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type ForwardIt
   can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.
   -
   BinaryPred must meet the requirements of BinaryPredicate.

Return value

   An iterator to the first of the first pair of identical elements, that
   is, the first iterator it such that *it == *(it + 1) for (1,2) or
   p(*it, *(it + 1)) != false for (3,4).

   If no such elements are found, last is returned.

Complexity

   Given result as the return value of adjacent_find, \(\scriptsize M\)M
   as std::distance(first, result) and \(\scriptsize N\)N as
   std::distance(first, last):
   1) Exactly \(\scriptsize \min(M+1,N-1)\)min(M+1,N-1) comparisons using
   operator==.
   2) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) comparisons using operator==.
   3) Exactly \(\scriptsize \min(M+1,N-1)\)min(M+1,N-1) applications of
   the predicate p.
   4) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) applications of the predicate p.

Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Possible implementation

               adjacent_find (1)
template<class ForwardIt>
ForwardIt adjacent_find(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last)
{
    if (first == last)
        return last;

    ForwardIt next = first;
    ++next;

    for (; next != last; ++next, ++first)
        if (*first == *next)
            return first;

    return last;
}

               adjacent_find (3)
template<class ForwardIt, class BinaryPred>
ForwardIt adjacent_find(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, BinaryPred p)
{
    if (first == last)
        return last;

    ForwardIt next = first;
    ++next;

    for (; next != last; ++next, ++first)
        if (p(*first, *next))
            return first;

    return last;
}

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v1{0, 1, 2, 3, 40, 40, 41, 41, 5};

    auto i1 = std::adjacent_find(v1.begin(), v1.end());

    if (i1 == v1.end())
        std::cout << "No matching adjacent elements\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The first adjacent pair of equal elements is at "
                  << std::distance(v1.begin(), i1) << ", *i1 = "
                  << *i1 << '\n';

    auto i2 = std::adjacent_find(v1.begin(), v1.end(), std::greater<int>());
    if (i2 == v1.end())
        std::cout << "The entire vector is sorted in ascending order\n";
    else
        std::cout << "The last element in the non-decreasing subsequence is at "
                  << std::distance(v1.begin(), i2) << ", *i2 = " << *i2 << '\n';
}

   Output:
The first adjacent pair of equal elements is at 4, *i1 = 40
The last element in the non-decreasing subsequence is at 7, *i2 = 41

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 240 C++98 the predicate was applied std::find
   (first, last, value) - first times
   for (1,3), where value was never defined applied std::min(
   (result - first) + 1,
   (last - first) - 1) times
