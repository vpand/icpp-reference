   size_type size() const;
   (noexcept since C++11)
   (constexpr since C++20)

   Returns the number of elements in the container, i.e.
   std::distance(begin(), end()).

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The number of elements in the container.

Complexity

   Constant.

Example

   The following code uses size to display the number of elements in a
   std::vector<int>:
   Run this code
#include <vector>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> nums {1, 3, 5, 7};

    std::cout << "nums contains " << nums.size() << " elements.\n";
}

   Output:
nums contains 4 elements.
