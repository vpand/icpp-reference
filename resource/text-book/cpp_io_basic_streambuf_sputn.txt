   std::streamsize sputn( const char_type* s, std::streamsize count );
   (1)
   protected:
   virtual std::streamsize xsputn( const char_type* s, std::streamsize
   count );
   (2)
   1) Calls xsputn(s, count) of the most derived class.
   2) Writes count characters to the output sequence from the character
   array whose first element is pointed to by s. The characters are
   written as if by repeated calls to sputc(). Writing stops when either
   count characters are written or a call to sputc() would have returned
   Traits::eof().

   If the put area becomes full (pptr() == epptr()), it is unspecified
   whether overflow() is actually called or its effect is achieved by
   other means.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The number of characters successfully written.

Notes

   "achieved by other means" permits bulk I/O without intermediate
   buffering: that is how std::ofstream::write() simply passes the pointer
   to the suitable system call in some implementations.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::ostringstream s1;
    std::streamsize sz = s1.rdbuf()->sputn("This is a test", 14);
    s1 << '\n';
    std::cout << "The call to sputn() returned " << sz << '\n'
              << "The output sequence contains " << s1.str();

    std::istringstream s2;
    sz = s2.rdbuf()->sputn("This is a test", 14);
    std::cout << "The call to sputn() on an input stream returned " << sz << '\n
';
}

   Output:
The call to sputn() returned 14
The output sequence contains This is a test
The call to sputn() on an input stream returned 0

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 565 C++98 xsputn() always called overflow() if pptr() == epptr() it
   does not actually need to be called
