   Defined in header <uchar.h>
   size_t c8rtomb( char* restrict s, char8_t c8, mbstate_t* restrict ps );
   (since C23)

   Converts a single code point from UTF-8 to a narrow multibyte character
   representation.

   If s is not a null pointer and c8 is the last code unit in a valid
   UTF-8 encoding of a code point, the function determines the number of
   bytes necessary to store the multibyte character representation of that
   code point (including any shift sequences, and taking into account the
   current multibyte conversion state *ps), and stores the multibyte
   character representation in the character array whose first element is
   pointed to by s, updating *ps as necessary. At most MB_CUR_MAX bytes
   can be written by this function.

   If c8 is not the final UTF-8 code unit in a representation of a code
   point, the function does not write to the array pointed to by s, only
   *ps is updated.

   If s is a null pointer, the call is equivalent to c8rtomb(buf, u8'\0',
   ps) for some internal buffer buf.

   If c8 is the null character u8'\0', a null byte is stored, preceded by
   any shift sequence necessary to restore the initial shift state and the
   conversion state parameter *ps is updated to represent the initial
   shift state.

   The multibyte encoding used by this function is specified by the
   currently active C locale.

Parameters

   s - pointer to narrow character array where the multibyte character
   will be stored
   c8 - the UTF-8 code unit to convert
   ps - pointer to the conversion state object used when interpreting the
   multibyte string

Return value

   The number of bytes stored in the array object (including any shift
   sequences). This may be zero when c8 is not the final code unit in the
   UTF-8 representation of a code point.

   If c8 is invalid (does not contribute to a sequence of char8_t
   corresponding to a valid multibyte character), the value of the macro
   EILSEQ is stored in errno, (size_t)-1 is returned, and the conversion
   state is unspecified.

Notes

   Calls to c8rtomb with a null pointer argument for s may introduce a
   data race with other calls to c8rtomb with a null pointer argument for
   s.
