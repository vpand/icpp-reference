   void reset() noexcept;
   (1)                   (library fundamentals TS v3)
   template< class RR >
   void reset( RR&& r );
   (2)                   (library fundamentals TS v3)
   1) Disposes the resource by calling the deleter with the underlying
   resource handle if the unique_resource owns it. The unique_resource
   does not own the resource after the call.
   2) Replaces the resource by calling (1) and then assigns the stored
   resource handle with std::forward<RR>(r) if
   std::is_nothrow_assignable_v<RS, RR> is true, otherwise
   std::as_const(r), where RS is the type of stored resource handle. The
   unique_resource owns the resource after the call.
   If copy-assignment of the store resource handle throws an exception,
   calls del_(r), where del is the deleter object.
   This overload participates in overload resolution only if the selected
   assignment expression assigning the stored resource handle is
   well-formed.
   The program is ill-formed if del_(r) is ill-formed.
   The behavior is undefined if del_(r) results in undefined behavior or
   throws an exception.

Parameters

   r - resource handle for a new resource to manage

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   2) Any exception thrown in assigning the stored resource handle.

Notes

   The mechanism ensures no leaking of resources.
