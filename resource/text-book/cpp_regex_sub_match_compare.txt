   int compare( const sub_match& m ) const;
   (1)                                       (since C++11)
   int compare( const string_type& s ) const;

   int compare( const value_type* c ) const;
   (3)                                       (since C++11)
   1) Compares two sub_match directly by comparing their underlying
   character sequences. Equivalent to str().compare(m.str()).
   2) Compares a sub_match with a std::basic_string. Equivalent to
   str().compare(s).
   3) Compares a sub_match with a null-terminated sequence of the
   underlying character type pointed to by s. Equivalent to
   str().compare(c).

   This function is infrequently used directly by application code.
   Instead, one of the non-member comparison operators is used.

Parameters

   m - a reference to another sub_match
   s - a reference to a string to compare to
   c - a pointer to a null-terminated character sequence of the underlying
   value_type to compare to

Return value

   A value less than zero if this sub_match is less than the other
   character sequence, zero if the both underlying character sequences are
   equal, greater than zero if this sub_match is greater than the other
   character sequence.
