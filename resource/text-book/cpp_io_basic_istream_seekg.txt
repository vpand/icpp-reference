   basic_istream& seekg( pos_type pos );
   (1)
   basic_istream& seekg( off_type off, std::ios_base::seekdir dir );
   (2)

   Sets input position indicator of the current associated streambuf
   object.
   Before doing anything else, seekg clears eofbit. (since C++11)

   seekg behaves as UnformattedInputFunction, except that gcount() is not
   affected. After constructing and checking the sentry object,
   1) if fail() != true, sets the input position indicator to absolute
   (relative to the beginning of the file) value pos. Specifically,
   executes rdbuf()->pubseekpos(pos, std::ios_base::in) (pubseekpos, in
   turn, calls seekpos of the specific buffer, such as
   basic_filebuf::seekpos, basic_stringbuf::seekpos, or
   strstreambuf::seekpos). In case of failure, calls
   setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).
   2) if fail() != true, sets the input position indicator to position
   off, relative to position, defined by dir. Specifically, executes
   rdbuf()->pubseekoff(off, dir, std::ios_base::in). In case of failure,
   calls setstate(std::ios_base::failbit).

Parameters

   pos - absolute position to set the input position indicator to
   off - relative position (positive or negative) to set the input
   position indicator to
   dir - defines base position to apply the relative offset to. It can be
   one of the following constants:
   Constant Explanation
   beg      the beginning of a stream
   end      the ending of a stream
   cur      the current position of stream position indicator

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and
   exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit
   is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

Notes

   seekg(n) is not necessarily equivalent to seekg(n, ios::beg).
   std::basic_ifstream, for example, requires the absolute position n to
   come from tellg().

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string str = "Hello, world";
    std::istringstream in(str);
    std::string word1, word2;

    in >> word1;
    in.seekg(0); // rewind
    in >> word2;

    std::cout << "word1 = " << word1 << '\n'
              << "word2 = " << word2 << '\n';
}

   Output:
word1 = Hello,
word2 = Hello,

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 129 C++98 there was no way to indicate a failure sets failbit on
   failure
   LWG 136 C++98 seekg could set the output stream only sets the input
   stream
   LWG 537 C++98 the type of off was off_type& corrected to off_type
