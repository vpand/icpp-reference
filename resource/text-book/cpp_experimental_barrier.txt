   Defined in header <experimental/barrier>
   class barrier;
                                           (concurrency TS)

   The class std::experimental::barrier provides a thread-coordination
   mechanism that allows a set of participating threads to block until an
   operation is completed. Unlike std::experimental::latch, barriers are
   reusable; once the participating threads are released from a barrier's
   synchronization point, they can reuse the same barrier.

   A barrier has a completion phase, which is executed by one of the
   participating threads once all threads in the set of participating
   threads arrive at the synchronization point. The arrive_and_wait and
   arrive_and_drop calls synchronize with the start of the completion
   phase; the end of the completion phase synchronizes with the returns
   from all calls blocked by its completion.

   For std::experimental::barrier, the completion phase is empty.
   std::experimental::flex_barrier allows the user to control the
   completion phase with a function object.

   The set of participating threads for a barrier constructed for
   num_threads threads is the first num_threads threads to arrive at its
   synchronization point after construction. The same set of threads
   (except for threads that called arrive_and_drop()) must arrive at the
   barrier each cycle.
