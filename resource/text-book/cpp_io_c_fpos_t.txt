   Defined in header <cstdio>
   typedef /* implementation-defined */ fpos_t;

   std::fpos_t is a non-array complete object type, can be used to store
   (by std::fgetpos) and restore (by std::fsetpos) the position and
   multibyte parser state (if any) for a C stream.

   The multibyte parser state of a wide-oriented C stream is represented
   by a std::mbstate_t object, whose value is stored as part of the value
   of a std::fpos_t object by std::fgetpos.
