   Defined in header <stdlib.h>
   int at_quick_exit( void (*func)(void) );
                                           (since C11)

   Registers the function pointed to by func to be called on quick program
   termination (via quick_exit).

   Calling the function from several threads does not induce a data race.
   The implementation is guaranteed to support the registration of at
   least 32 functions. The exact limit is implementation-defined.

   The registered functions will not be called on normal program
   termination. If a function need to be called in that case, atexit must
   be used.

Parameters

   func - pointer to a function to be called on quick program termination

Return value

   0 if the registration succeeds, nonzero value otherwise.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void f1(void)
{
    puts("pushed first");
    fflush(stdout);
}

void f2(void)
{
    puts("pushed second");
}

int main(void)
{
    at_quick_exit(f1);
    at_quick_exit(f2);
    quick_exit(0);
}

   Output:
pushed second
pushed first
