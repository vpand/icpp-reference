   bool is_open() const;

   Checks if the file stream has an associated file.

   Effectively calls rdbuf()->is_open().

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   true if the file stream has an associated file, false otherwise.

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// this file is called main.cpp

bool file_exists(const std::string& str)
{
    std::ifstream fs(str);
    return fs.is_open();
}

int main()
{
    std::boolalpha(std::cout);
    std::cout << file_exists("main.cpp")  << '\n'
              << file_exists("strange_file") << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
true
false
