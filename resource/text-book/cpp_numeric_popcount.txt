   Defined in header <bit>
   template< class T >
   constexpr int popcount( T x ) noexcept;
                          (since C++20)

   Returns the number of 1 bits in the value of x.

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if T is an
   unsigned integer type (that is, unsigned char, unsigned short, unsigned
   int, unsigned long, unsigned long long, or an extended unsigned integer
   type).

Parameters

   x - value of unsigned integer type

Return value

   The number of 1 bits in the value of x.

Notes

   The name popcount is a contraction for "population count".

Example

   Run this code
#include <bit>
#include <bitset>
#include <cstdint>
#include <iostream>

static_assert(std::popcount(0xFULL) == 4);

int main()
{
    for (const std::uint8_t x : {0, 0b00011101, 0b11111111})
        std::cout << "popcount( " << std::bitset<8>(x) << " ) = "
                  << std::popcount(x) << '\n';
}

   Output:
popcount( 00000000 ) = 0
popcount( 00011101 ) = 4
popcount( 11111111 ) = 8
