   Defined in header <spanstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
   > class basic_spanbuf

   std::basic_spanbuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character
   sequence is a memory-resident sequence of arbitrary characters, which
   can be initialized from or made available as an instance of
   std::span<CharT>.

   std::basic_spanbuf performs I/O on a fixed buffer, and therefore it
   does not attempt to obtain a new buffer when the underlying buffer is
   exhausted.

   Several typedefs for common character types are provided:
   Defined in header <spanstream>
   Type          Definition
   std::spanbuf  std::basic_spanbuf<char>
   std::wspanbuf std::basic_spanbuf<wchar_t>

   off_type Traits::off_type

Data members

Notes

   std::basic_spanbuf does not own the underlying buffer.

   It is the responsibility of programmers to ensure the underlying buffer
   is in its lifetime when used by a std::basic_spanbuf object. Additional
   synchronization may be needed if more than one thread operates the same
   underlying buffer through different std::basic_spanbuf objects.
