   Defined in header <locale>
   public:
   string_type curr_symbol() const;
   (1)
   protected:
   virtual string_type do_curr_symbol() const;
   (2)
   1) Public member function, calls the member function do_curr_symbol of
   the most derived class.
   2) Returns the string used as the currency identifier by this locale.
   If International (the second template parameter of std::moneypunct) is
   false, the identifier is usually a single (wide) character, such as "¥"
   or "$". If International is true, the identifier is usually a
   four-character string holding the three-character ISO 4217 currency
   code followed by a space ("JPY " or "USD ").

Return value

   The object of type string_type holding the currency symbol or code.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

void show_ccy(const char* locname)
{
    std::locale loc(locname);
    std::cout << locname << " currency symbol is "
              << std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char, true>>(loc).curr_symbol()
              << "or " << std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char>>(loc).curr_symbol
()
              << " for short\n";
}

int main()
{
    show_ccy("en_US.utf8");
    show_ccy("ja_JP.utf8");
    show_ccy("sv_SE.utf8");
    show_ccy("ru_RU.utf8");
    show_ccy("vi_VN.utf8");
}

   Output:
en_US.utf8 currency symbol is USD or $ for short
ja_JP.utf8 currency symbol is JPY or ¥ for short
sv_SE.utf8 currency symbol is SEK or kr for short
ru_RU.utf8 currency symbol is RUB or rub for short
vi_VN.utf8 currency symbol is VND or d_ for short

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 666 C++98 the length of the identifier string was required to be 4
   if International is true not required
