   Defined in header <cwchar>
   wchar_t* wcsncpy( wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, std::size_t count
   );

   Copies at most count characters of the wide string pointed to by src
   (including the terminating null wide character) to wide character array
   pointed to by dest.

   If count is reached before the entire string src was copied, the
   resulting wide character array is not null-terminated.

   If, after copying the terminating null wide character from src, count
   is not reached, additional null wide characters are written to dest
   until the total of count characters have been written.

   If the strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.

Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the wide character array to copy to
   src   - pointer to the wide string to copy from
   count - maximum number of wide characters to copy

Return value

   dest

Notes

   In typical usage, count is the size of the destination array.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const wchar_t src[] = L"hi";
    wchar_t dest[6] = {L'a', L'b', L'c', L'd', L'e', L'f'};

    std::wcsncpy(dest, src, 5); // this will copy 'hi' and repeat \0 three times

    std::wcout << "The contents of dest are: ";
    for (const wchar_t c : dest)
    {
        if (c)
            std::wcout << c << ' ';
        else
            std::wcout << "\\0" << ' ';
    }
    std::wcout << '\n';
}

   Output:
The contents of dest are: h i \0 \0 \0 f
