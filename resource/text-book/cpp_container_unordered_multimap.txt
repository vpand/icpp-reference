   std::unordered_multimap is an unordered associative container that
   supports equivalent keys (an unordered_multimap may contain multiple
   copies of each key value) and that associates values of another type
   with the keys. The unordered_multimap class supports forward iterators.
   Search, insertion, and removal have average constant-time complexity.

   Internally, the elements are not sorted in any particular order, but
   organized into buckets. Which bucket an element is placed into depends
   entirely on the hash of its key. This allows fast access to individual
   elements, since once the hash is computed, it refers to the exact
   bucket the element is placed into.

   The iteration order of this container is not required to be stable (so,
   for example, std::equal cannot be used to compare two
   std::unordered_multimaps), except that every group of elements whose
   keys compare equivalent (compare equal with key_eq() as the comparator)
   forms a contiguous subrange in the iteration order, also accessible
   with equal_range().

   std::unordered_multimap meets the requirements of Container,
   AllocatorAwareContainer, UnorderedAssociativeContainer.

   container node
