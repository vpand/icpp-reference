   The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for tagged provides the
   ability to obtain the number of elements in a tagged object using
   tuple-like syntax. It simply forwards to std::tuple_size<Base>.

Inherited from std::integral_constant

Member constants

   value
   [static]
   std::tuple_size<Base>::value
   (public static member constant)

Member functions

   operator std::size_t
   converts the object to std::size_t, returns value
   (public member function)
   operator()
   (C++14)
   returns value
   (public member function)
