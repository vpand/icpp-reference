   Defined in header <float.h>
   #define FLT_ROUNDS /* implementation defined */

   Returns the current rounding direction of floating-point arithmetic
   operations.
   Value        Explanation
   -1           the default rounding direction is not known
   0            toward zero; same meaning as FE_TOWARDZERO
   1            to nearest; same meaning as FE_TONEAREST
   2            towards positive infinity; same meaning as FE_UPWARD
   3            towards negative infinity; same meaning as FE_DOWNWARD
   other values implementation-defined behavior

Notes

   The rounding mode can be changed with fesetround and FLT_ROUNDS
   reflects that change.
