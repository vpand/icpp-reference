   Defined in header <stdio.h>
   void setbuf( FILE          *stream, char          *buffer );
                                                               (until C99)
   void setbuf( FILE *restrict stream, char *restrict buffer );
                                                               (since C99)
   #define BUFSIZ     /*unspecified*/

   Sets the internal buffer to use for stream operations. It should be at
   least BUFSIZ characters long.

   If buffer is not null, equivalent to setvbuf(stream, buffer, _IOFBF,
   BUFSIZ).

   If buffer is null, equivalent to setvbuf(stream, NULL, _IONBF, 0),
   which turns off buffering.

Parameters

   stream - the file stream to set the buffer to
   buffer - pointer to a buffer for the stream to use. If a null pointer
   is supplied, the buffering is turned off

Return value

   None.

Notes

   If BUFSIZ is not the appropriate buffer size, setvbuf can be used to
   change it.

   setvbuf should also be used to detect errors, since setbuf does not
   indicate success or failure.

   This function may only be used after stream has been associated with an
   open file, but before any other operation (other than a failed call to
   setbuf/setvbuf).

   A common error is setting the buffer of stdin or stdout to an array
   whose lifetime ends before the program terminates:
int main(void) {
    char buf[BUFSIZ];
    setbuf(stdin, buf);
} // lifetime of buf ends, undefined behavior

Example

   setbuf may be used to disable buffering on streams that require
   immediate output.
   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <threads.h>

int main(void)
{
    setbuf(stdout, NULL); // unbuffered stdout
    putchar('a'); // 'a' appears immediately if stdout is unbuffered
    thrd_sleep(&(struct timespec){.tv_sec=1}, NULL); // sleep 1 sec
    putchar('b');
}

   Output:
ab
