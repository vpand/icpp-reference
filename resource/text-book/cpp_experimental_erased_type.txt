   Defined in header <experimental/utility>
   struct erased_type { };
   (library fundamentals TS)
   (removed in library fundamentals TS v3)

   The class erased_type is an empty struct that serves as a placeholder
   for a type in situations where the actual type is determined at
   runtime. For example, in classes that use type-erased allocators, the
   nested typedef allocator_type is an alias for erased_type.

Notes

   erased_type is removed in LFTS v3 because
   std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<> is preferable for type erasure.
