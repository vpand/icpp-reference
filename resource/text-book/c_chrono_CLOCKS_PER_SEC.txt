   Defined in header <time.h>
   #define CLOCKS_PER_SEC /*implementation defined*/

   Expands to an expression (not necessarily a compile-time constant) of
   type clock_t equal to the number of clock ticks per second, as returned
   by clock().

Notes

   POSIX defines CLOCKS_PER_SEC as one million, regardless of the actual
   precision of clock.

   Until standardized as CLOCKS_PER_SEC in C89, this macro was sometimes
   known by its IEEE std 1003.1-1988 name CLK_TCK: that name was not
   included in C89 and was removed from POSIX itself in 1996 over
   ambiguity with _SC_CLK_TCK, which gives number of clocks per second for
   the function times()).
