   Defined in header <syncstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>
   > class basic_syncbuf : public std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>
                                 (since C++20)

   std::basic_syncbuf is a wrapper for a std::basic_streambuf (provided at
   construction time as a pointer). It accumulates output in its own
   internal buffer, and atomically transmits its entire contents to the
   wrapped buffer on destruction and when explicitly requested, so that
   they appear as a contiguous sequence of characters. It guarantees that
   there are no data races and no interleaving of characters sent to the
   wrapped buffer as long as all other outputs made to the same buffer are
   made through, possibly different, instances of std::basic_syncbuf.

   Typical implementation of std::basic_syncbuf holds a pointer to the
   wrapped std::basic_streambuf, a boolean flag indicating whether the
   buffer will transmit its contents to the wrapped buffer on sync
   (flush), a boolean flag indicating a pending flush when the policy is
   to not emit on sync, an internal buffer that uses Allocator (such as
   std::string), and a pointer to a mutex used to synchronize emit between
   multiple threads accessing the same wrapped stream buffer (these
   mutexes may be in a hash map with pointers to std::basic_streambuf
   objects used as keys).

   Like other streambuf classes, std::basic_syncbuf is normally only
   accessed through the corresponding stream, std::osyncstream, not
   directly.

   Several typedefs for common character types are provided:
   Defined in header <syncstream>
   Type          Definition
   std::syncbuf  std::basic_syncbuf<char>
   std::wsyncbuf std::basic_syncbuf<wchar_t>
