   pos_type tellg();

   Returns input position indicator of the current associated streambuf
   object.

   Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction, except that gcount() is not
   affected. After constructing and checking the sentry object, if fail()
   == true, returns pos_type(-1). Otherwise, returns
   rdbuf()->pubseekoff(0, std::ios_base::cur, std::ios_base::in).

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The current position of the get pointer on success, pos_type(-1) on
   failure.

Exceptions

   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and
   exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit
   is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string str = "Hello, world";
    std::istringstream in(str);
    std::string word;
    in >> word;
    std::cout << "After reading the word \"" << word
              << "\" tellg() returns " << in.tellg() << '\n';
}

   Output:
After reading the word "Hello," tellg() returns 6
