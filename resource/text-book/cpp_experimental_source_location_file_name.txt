   Returns the name of the current source file represented by this object,
   represented as a null-terminated byte string.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The name of the current source file represented by this object,
   represented as a null-terminated byte string.

Example

   Run this code
#include <experimental/source_location>
#include <iostream>

inline void print_this_file_name(
    const std::experimental::source_location& location
        = std::experimental::source_location::current())
{
    // Name of file that contains the call-site of this function.
    std::cout << "File: " << location.file_name() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    print_this_file_name();
}

   Possible output:
File: main.cpp
