   weak_ptr<T> exchange( weak_ptr<T> desired, std::memory_order order =
   std::memory_order_seq_cst ) noexcept;

   Atomically replaces the underlying weak_ptr with desired. The operation
   is a read-modify-write operation. Memory is affected according to the
   value of order.

Parameters

   desired - value to assign
   order   - memory order constraints to enforce

Return value

   The value of the atomic variable before the call.

Remarks

   All changes to the atomic_weak_ptr object itself, and all associated
   use_count increments, are guaranteed to be performed atomically.
   Associated use_count decrements take place after the atomic operation,
   but are not required to be part of it. Any associated destruction or
   deallocation operations take place after the atomic operation and are
   not part of it.
