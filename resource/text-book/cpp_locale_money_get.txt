       class CharT,
       class InputIt = std::istreambuf_iterator<CharT>
   > class money_get;

   Class template std::money_get encapsulates the rules for parsing
   monetary values from character streams. The standard I/O manipulator
   std::get_money uses the std::money_get facet of the I/O stream's
   locale.

   Inheritance diagram

   If a std::money_get specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by
   the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its get() and
   do_get() are not guaranteed as specified.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale
   object):
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::money_get<char> parses narrow string representations of monetary
   values
   std::money_get<wchar_t> parses wide string representations of monetary
   values

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every
   specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:
     * CharT is one of
          + char,
          + wchar_t, and
          + any other implementation-defined character container type that
            meets the requirements for a character on which any of the
            iostream components can be instantiated; and
     * InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   char_type   CharT
   string_type std::basic_string<CharT>
   iter_type   InputIt

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new money_get facet
   (public member function)
   get
   invokes do_get
   (public member function)

Protected member functions

   (destructor)
   destructs a money_get facet
   (protected member function)
   do_get
   [virtual]
   parses a monetary value from an input stream
   (virtual protected member function)

Member objects

   static std::locale::id id
   id of the locale
   (public member object)

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::string str = "$1.11 $2.22 $3.33";
    std::cout << std::fixed << std::setprecision(2);

    std::cout << '\"' << str << "\" parsed with the I/O manipulator: ";
    std::istringstream s1(str);
    s1.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));

    long double val;
    while (s1 >> std::get_money(val))
        std::cout << val / 100 << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';

    str = "USD  1,234.56";
    std::cout << '\"' << str << "\" parsed with the facet directly: ";
    std::istringstream s2(str);
    s2.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));

    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::money_get<char>>(s2.getloc());
    std::ios_base::iostate err;
    std::istreambuf_iterator<char> beg(s2), end;
    f.get(beg, end, true, s2, err, val);

    std::cout << val / 100 << '\n';
}

   Output:
"$1.11 $2.22 $3.33" parsed with the I/O manipulator: 1.11 2.22 3.33
"USD  1,234.56" parsed with the facet directly: 1234.56

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 427 C++98 money_get was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
   meets the requirements for a character on which
   any of the iostream components can be instantiated only guarantees to
   accept char,
   wchar_t and other implementation-
   defined character types
   LWG 2392 C++98 only character type CharT could be
   guaranteed to be accepted by money_get can guarantee to accept
   implementation-
   defined character container types
