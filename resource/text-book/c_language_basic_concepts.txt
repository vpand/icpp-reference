   This section provides definitions for the specific terminology and the
   concepts used when describing the C programming language.

   A C program is a sequence of text files (typically header and source
   files) that contain declarations. They undergo translation to become an
   executable program, which is executed when the OS calls its main
   function (unless it is itself the OS or another freestanding program,
   in which case the entry point is implementation-defined).

   Certain words in a C program have special meaning, they are keywords.
   Others can be used as identifiers, which may be used to identify
   objects, functions, struct, union, or enumeration tags, their members,
   typedef names, labels, or macros.

   Each identifier (other than macro) is only valid within a part of the
   program called its scope and belongs to one of four kinds of name
   spaces. Some identifiers have linkage which makes them refer to the
   same entities when they appear in different scopes or translation
   units.

   Definitions of functions include sequences of statements and
   declarations, some of which include expressions, which specify the
   computations to be performed by the program.

   Declarations and expressions create, destroy, access, and manipulate
   objects. Each object, function, and expression in C is associated with
   a type.
