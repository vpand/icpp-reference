   Defined in header <threads.h>
   int thrd_create( thrd_t *thr, thrd_start_t func, void *arg );
                                                                (since C11)

   Creates a new thread executing the function func. The function is
   invoked as func(arg).

   If successful, the object pointed to by thr is set to the identifier of
   the new thread.

   The completion of this function synchronizes-with the beginning of the
   thread.

Parameters

   thr - pointer to memory location to put the identifier of the new
   thread
   func - function to execute
   arg - argument to pass to the function

Return value

   thrd_success if the creation of the new thread was successful.
   Otherwise returns thrd_nomem if there was insufficient amount of memory
   or thrd_error if another error occurred.

Notes

   The thread identifiers may be reused for new threads once the thread
   has finished and joined or detached.

   The type thrd_start_t is a typedef of int(*)(void*), which differs from
   the POSIX equivalent void*(*)(void*)

   All thread-specific storage values (see tss_create) are initialized to
   NULL.

   Return from the function func is equivalent to calling thrd_exit with
   the argument equal to the return value of func.
