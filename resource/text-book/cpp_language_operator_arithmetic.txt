          Notes

     * All operators in this table are overloadable.
     * All built-in operators return values, and most user-defined
       overloads also return values so that the user-defined operators can
       be used in the same manner as the built-ins. However, in a
       user-defined operator overload, any type can be used as return type
       (including void). In particular, stream insertion and stream
       extraction overloads of operator<< and operator>> return T&.
     * T2 can be any type including T.

General explanation

   All built-in arithmetic operators compute the result of specific
   arithmetic operation and returns its result. The arguments are not
   modified.

Conversions

   If the operand passed to a built-in arithmetic operator is integral or
   unscoped enumeration type, then before any other action (but after
   lvalue-to-rvalue conversion, if applicable), the operand undergoes
   integral promotion. If an operand has array or function type,
   array-to-pointer and function-to-pointer conversions are applied.

   For the binary operators (except shifts), if the promoted operands have
   different types, usual arithmetic conversions are applied.

Overflows

   Unsigned integer arithmetic is always performed modulo 2n
   where n is the number of bits in that particular integer. E.g. for
   unsigned int, adding one to UINT_MAX gives 0, and subtracting one from
   0 gives UINT_MAX.

   When signed integer arithmetic operation overflows (the result does not
   fit in the result type), the behavior is undefined, -- the possible
   manifestations of such an operation include:
     * it wraps around according to the rules of the representation
       (typically two's complement),
     * it traps -- on some platforms or due to compiler options (e.g.
       -ftrapv in GCC and Clang),
     * it saturates to minimal or maximal value (on many DSPs),
     * it is completely optimized out by the compiler.

Floating-point environment

   If #pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS is supported and set to ON, all
   floating-point arithmetic operators obey the current floating-point
   rounding direction and report floating-point arithmetic errors as
   specified in math_errhandling unless part of a static initializer (in
   which case floating-point exceptions are not raised and the rounding
   mode is to nearest).

Floating-point contraction

   Unless #pragma STDC FP_CONTRACT is supported and set to OFF, all
   floating-point arithmetic may be performed as if the intermediate
   results have infinite range and precision, that is, optimizations that
   omit rounding errors and floating-point exceptions are allowed. For
   example, C++ allows the implementation of (x * y) + z with a single
   fused multiply-add CPU instruction or optimization of a = x * x * x *
   x; as tmp = x * x; a = tmp * tmp.

   Unrelated to contracting, intermediate results of floating-point
   arithmetic may have range and precision that is different from the one
   indicated by its type, see FLT_EVAL_METHOD.

   Formally, the C++ standard makes no guarantee on the accuracy of
   floating-point operations.

Unary arithmetic operators

   The unary arithmetic operator expressions have the form
   + expression (1)
   - expression (2)
   1) Unary plus (promotion).
   2) Unary minus (negation).

   Unary + and - operators have higher precedence than all binary
   arithmetic operators, so expression cannot contain top-level binary
   arithmetic operators. These operators associate from right to left:
+a - b; // equivalent to (+a) - b, NOT +(a - b)
-c + d; // equivalent to (-c) + d, NOT -(c + d)

+-e; // equivalent to +(-e), the unary + is a no-op if "e" is a built-in type
     // because any possible promotion is performed during negation already

Built-in unary arithmetic operators

   1) For the built-in unary plus operator, expression must be a prvalue
   of arithmetic, unscoped enumeration, or pointer type. Integral
   promotion is performed on expression if it has integral or unscoped
   enumeration type. The type of the result is the (possibly promoted)
   type of expression.
   The result of the built-in promotion is the value of expression. The
   built-in unary operation is no-op if the operand is a prvalue of a
   promoted integral type or a pointer type. Otherwise, the type or value
   category of the operand is changed by integral promotion or
   lvalue-to-rvalue, array-to-pointer, function-to-pointer, or
   user-defined conversion. For example, char is converted to int , and
   non-generic captureless lambda expression is converted to function
   pointer(since C++11) in unary plus expressions.
   2) For the built-in unary minus operator, expression must be a prvalue
   of arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type. Integral promotion is
   performed on expression. The type of the result is the type of the
   promoted type of expression.
   The result of the built-in negation is the negative of the promoted
   expression. For unsigned a, the value of -a is \({\small 2^N-a}\)2N
   -a, where N is the number of bits after promotion.
     * In other words, the result is the two's complement of the operand
       (where operand and result are considered as unsigned).

Overloads

   In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every
   cv-unqualified promoted arithmetic type A and for every type T, the
   following function signatures participate in overload resolution:
   A operator+(A)
   T* operator+(T*)
   A operator-(A)
   Run this code
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char c = 0x6a;
    int n1 = 1;
    unsigned char n2 = 1;
    unsigned int n3 = 1;
    std::cout << "char: " << c << " int: " << +c << "\n"
                 "-1, where 1 is signed: " << -n1 << "\n"
                 "-1, where 1 is unsigned char: " << -n2 << "\n"
                 "-1, where 1 is unsigned int: " << -n3 << '\n';
    char a[3];
    std::cout << "size of array: " << sizeof a << "\n"
                 "size of pointer: " << sizeof +a << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
char: j int: 106
-1, where 1 is signed: -1
-1, where 1 is unsigned char: -1
-1, where 1 is unsigned int: 4294967295
size of array: 3
size of pointer: 8

Additive operators

   The additive operator expressions have the form
   lhs + rhs (1)
   lhs - rhs (2)
   1) Binary plus (addition).
   2) Binary minus (subtraction).

   Binary + and - operators have higher precedence than all other binary
   arithmetic operators except *, / and %. These operators associate from
   left to right:
a + b * c;  // equivalent to a + (b * c),  NOT (a + b) * c
d / e - f;  // equivalent to (d / e) - f,  NOT d / (e - f)
g + h >> i; // equivalent to (g + h) >> i, NOT g + (h >> i)

j - k + l - m; // equivalent to ((j - k) + l) - m

Built-in additive operators

   For built-in binary plus and binary minus operators, both of lhs and
   rhs must be prvalues, and one of the following conditions must be
   satisfied:
     * Both operands have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type. In this
       case, usual arithmetic conversions are performed on both operands.
     * Exactly one operand has integral or unscoped enumeration type. In
       this case, integral promotion is applied to that operand.

   In the remaining description in this section, "operand(s)", lhs and rhs
   refer to the converted or promoted operand(s).
   1) For built-in addition, one of the following conditions must be
   satisfied:
     * Both operands have arithmetic type. In this case, the result is the
       sum of the operands.
     * One operand is a pointer to a completely-defined object type, and
       the other operand has integral type. In this case, the integral
       value is added to the pointer (see pointer arithmetic).

   2) For built-in subtraction, one of the following conditions must be
   satisfied:
     * Both operands have arithmetic type. In this case, the result is the
       difference resulting from the subtraction of rhs from lhs.
     * lhs is a pointer to a completely-defined object type, and rhs has
       integral type. In this case, the integral value is subtracted from
       the pointer (see pointer arithmetic).
     * Both operands are pointers to cv-qualified or cv-unqualified
       versions of the same completely-defined object type. In this case
       rhs is subtracted from lhs (see pointer arithmetic).

   If both operands have a floating-point type, and the type supports IEEE
   floating-point arithmetic (see std::numeric_limits::is_iec559):
     * If one operand is NaN, the result is NaN.
     * Infinity minus infinity is NaN, and FE_INVALID is raised.
     * Infinity plus the negative infinity is NaN, and FE_INVALID is
       raised.

Pointer arithmetic

   When an expression J that has integral type is added to or subtracted
   from an expression P of pointer type, the result has the type of P.
     * If P evaluates to a null pointer value and J evaluates to 0, the
       result is a null pointer value.
     * Otherwise, if P points to the ith element of an array object x with
       n elements, given the value of J as j, P is added or subtracted as
       follows:

          + The expressions P + J and J + P

               o point to the i+jth element of x if i + j is in [0, n),
                 and
               o are pointers past the end of the last element of x if i +
                 j is n.

          + The expression P - J

               o points to the i-jth element of x if i - j is in [0, n),
                 and
               o is a pointer past the end of the last element of x if i -
                 j is n.

          + Other j values result in undefined behavior.

     * Otherwise, if P points to a complete object, a base class subobject
       or a member subobject y, given the value of J as j, P is added or
       subtracted as follows:

          + The expressions P + J and J + P

               o point to y if j is 0, and
               o are pointers past the end of y if j is 1.

          + The expression P - J

               o points to y if j is 0, and
               o is a pointer past the end of y if j is -1.

          + Other j values result in undefined behavior.

     * Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

   When two pointer expressions P and Q are subtracted, the type of the
   result is std::ptrdiff_t.
     * If P and Q both evaluate to null pointer values, the result is 0.
     * Otherwise, if P and Q point to, respectively, the ith and jth array
       elements of the same array object x, the expression P - Q has the
       value i - j.

          + If i - j is not representable by std::ptrdiff_t, the behavior
            is undefined.

     * Otherwise, if P and Q point to the same complete object, base class
       subobject or member subobject, the result is 0.
     * Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.

   These pointer arithmetic operators allow pointers to satisfy the
   LegacyRandomAccessIterator requirements.

   For addition and subtraction, if P or Q have type "pointer to (possibly
   cv-qualified) T", where T and the array element type are not similar,
   the behavior is undefined:
int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
unsigned int *p = reinterpret_cast<unsigned int*>(arr + 1);
unsigned int k = *p; // OK, the value of "k" is 2
unsigned int *q = p + 1; // undefined behavior: "p" points to int, not unsigned
int

Overloads

   In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every pair
   of promoted arithmetic types L and R and for every object type T, the
   following function signatures participate in overload resolution:
   LR operator+(L, R)
   LR operator-(L, R)
   T* operator+(T*, std::ptrdiff_t)
   T* operator+(std::ptrdiff_t, T*)
   T* operator-(T*, std::ptrdiff_t)
   std::ptrdiff_t operator-(T*, T*)

   where LR is the result of usual arithmetic conversions on L and R.
   Run this code
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char c = 2;
    unsigned int un = 2;
    int n = -10;
    std::cout << " 2 + (-10), where 2 is a char    = " << c + n << "\n"
                 " 2 + (-10), where 2 is unsigned  = " << un + n << "\n"
                 " -10 - 2.12  = " << n - 2.12 << '\n';

    char a[4] = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd'};
    char* p = &a[1];
    std::cout << "Pointer addition examples: " << *p << *(p + 2)
              << *(2 + p) << *(p - 1) << '\n';
    char* p2 = &a[4];
    std::cout << "Pointer difference: " << p2 - p << '\n';
}

   Output:
 2 + (-10), where 2 is a char    = -8
 2 + (-10), where 2 is unsigned  = 4294967288
 -10 - 2.12  = -12.12

Multiplicative operators

   The multiplicative operator expressions have the form
   lhs * rhs (1)
   lhs / rhs (2)
   lhs % rhs (3)
   1) Multiplication.
   2) Division.
   3) Remainder.

   Multiplicative operators have higher precedence than all other binary
   arithmetic operators. These operators associate from left to right:
a + b * c;  // equivalent to a + (b * c),  NOT (a + b) * c
d / e - f;  // equivalent to (d / e) - f,  NOT d / (e - f)
g % h >> i; // equivalent to (g % h) >> i, NOT g % (h >> i)

j * k / l % m; // equivalent to ((j * k) / l) % m

Built-in multiplicative operators

   For built-in multiplication and division operators, both operands must
   have arithmetic or unscoped enumeration type. For the built-in
   remainder operator, both operands must have integral or unscoped
   enumeration type. Usual arithmetic conversions are performed on both
   operands.

   In the remaining description in this section, "operand(s)", lhs and rhs
   refer to the converted operand(s).
   1) The result of built-in multiplication is the product of the
   operands.
   If both operands have a floating-point type, and the type supports IEEE
   floating-point arithmetic (see std::numeric_limits::is_iec559):
     * Multiplication of a NaN by any number gives NaN.
     * Multiplication of infinity by zero gives NaN and FE_INVALID is
       raised.

   2) The result of built-in division is lhs divided by rhs. If rhs is
   zero, the behavior is undefined.
   If both operands have an integral type, the result is the algebraic
   quotient (performs integer division): the quotient is truncated towards
   zero (fractional part is discarded).
   If both operands have a floating-point type, and the type supports IEEE
   floating-point arithmetic (see std::numeric_limits::is_iec559):
     * If one operand is NaN, the result is NaN.
     * Dividing a non-zero number by ±0.0 gives the correctly-signed
       infinity and FE_DIVBYZERO is raised.
     * Dividing 0.0 by 0.0 gives NaN and FE_INVALID is raised.

   3) The result of built-in remainder is the remainder of the integer
   division of lhs by rhs. If rhs is zero, the behavior is undefined.
   If a / b is representable in the result type, (a / b) * b + a % b == a.
   If a / b is not representable in the result type, the behavior of both
   a / b and a % b is undefined (that means INT_MIN % -1 is undefined on
   two's complement systems).

   Note: Until CWG issue 614 was resolved (N2757), if one or both operands
   to binary operator % were negative, the sign of the remainder was
   implementation-defined, as it depends on the rounding direction of
   integer division. The function std::div provided well-defined behavior
   in that case.

   Note: for floating-point remainder, see std::remainder and std::fmod.

Overloads

   In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every pair
   of promoted arithmetic types LA and RA and for every pair of promoted
   integral types LI and RI the following function signatures participate
   in overload resolution:
   LRA operator*(LA, RA)
   LRA operator/(LA, RA)
   LRI operator%(LI, RI)

   where LRx is the result of usual arithmetic conversions on Lx and Rx.
   Run this code
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char c = 2;
    unsigned int un = 2;
    int  n = -10;
    std::cout << "2 * (-10), where 2 is a char    = " << c * n << "\n"
                 "2 * (-10), where 2 is unsigned  = " << un * n << "\n"
                 "-10 / 2.12  = " << n / 2.12 << "\n"
                 "-10 / 21  = " << n / 21 << "\n"
                 "-10 % 21  = " << n % 21 << '\n';
}

   Output:
2 * (-10), where 2 is a char    = -20
2 * (-10), where 2 is unsigned  = 4294967276
-10 / 2.12  = -4.71698
-10 / 21  = 0
-10 % 21  = -10

Bitwise logic operators

   The bitwise logic operator expressions have the form
   ~ rhs     (1)
   lhs & rhs (2)
   lhs | rhs (3)
   lhs ^ rhs (4)
   1) Bitwise NOT.
   2) Bitwise AND.
   3) Bitwise OR.
   4) Bitwise XOR.

   The bitwise NOT operator has higher precedence than all binary
   arithmetic operators. It associates from right to left:
~a - b; // equivalent to (~a) - b, NOT ~(a - b)
~c * d; // equivalent to (~c) * d, NOT ~(c * d)

~-e; // equivalent to ~(-e)

   There is an ambiguity in the grammar when ~ is followed by a type name
   or decltype specifier(since C++11): it can either be operator~ or start
   a destructor identifier). The ambiguity is resolved by treating ~ as
   operator~. ~ can start a destructor identifier only in places where
   forming an operator~ is syntactically invalid.

   All other bitwise logic operators have lower precedence than all other
   binary arithmetic operators. Bitwise AND has higher precedence than
   bitwise XOR, which has higher precedence than bitwise OR. They
   associate from left to right:
a & b * c;  // equivalent to a & (b * c),  NOT (a & b) * c
d / e ^ f;  // equivalent to (d / e) ^ f,  NOT d / (e ^ f)
g << h | i; // equivalent to (g << h) | i, NOT g << (h | i)

j & k & l; // equivalent to (j & k) & l
m | n ^ o  // equivalent to m | (n ^ o)

Built-in bitwise logic operators

   For the built-in bitwise NOT operator, rhs must be a prvalue of
   integral or unscoped enumeration type, and integral promotion is
   performed on rhs. For other built-in bitwise logic operators, both
   operands must have integral or unscoped enumeration type, and usual
   arithmetic conversions are performed on both operands.

   In the remaining description in this section, "operand(s)", lhs and rhs
   refer to the converted or promoted operand(s).
   1) Given the operand as x and the result of the built-in bitwise NOT
   operation as r. For each coefficient x_i of the base-2 representation
   of x, the corresponding coefficient r_i of the base-2 representation of
   r is 1 if x_i is 0, and 0 otherwise.
     * In other words, the result is the one's complement of the operand
       (where operand and result are considered as unsigned).

   The type of the result r is the type of the operand x.
   2-4) Given the operands as x and y respectively and the result of the
   built-in binary bitwise logic operations as r. For each pair of
   coefficients x_i and y_i of the base-2 representations of x and y
   respectively, the corresponding coefficient r_i of the base-2
   representation of r is
   2) 1 if both x_i and y_i are 1, and 0 otherwise.
   3) 1 if at least one of x_i and y_i is 1, and 0 otherwise.

   of promoted integral types L and R the following function signatures
   participate in overload resolution:

Bitwise shift operators

   The bitwise shift operator expressions have the form
   lhs << rhs (1)
   lhs >> rhs (2)
   1) Bitwise left-shift.
   2) Bitwise right-shift.

   Bitwise shift operators have higher precedence than bitwise logic
   operators, but have lower precedence than additive and multiplicative
   operators. These operators associate from left to right:
a >> b * c;  // equivalent to a >> (b * c),  NOT (a >> b) * c
d << e & f;  // equivalent to (d << e) & f,  NOT d << (e & f)

g << h >> i; // equivalent to (g << h) >> i, NOT g << (h >> i)

Built-in bitwise shift operators

   For the built-in bitwise shift operators, both operands must be
   prvalues of integral or unscoped enumeration type. Integral promotions
   are performed on both operands.

   In the remaining description in this section, "operand(s)", a, b, lhs
   and rhs refer to the converted or promoted operand(s).

   If the value of rhs is negative or is not less than the number of bits
   in lhs, the behavior is undefined.

   For unsigned a, the value of a << b is the value of a * 2b
   , reduced modulo 2N
   where N is the number of bits in the return type (that is, bitwise left
   shift is performed and the bits that get shifted out of the destination
   type are discarded).

   For signed and non-negative a, if a * 2b
   is representable in the unsigned version of the return type, then that
   value, converted to signed, is the value of a << b (this makes it legal
   to create INT_MIN as 1 << 31); otherwise the behavior is undefined.

   For negative a, the behavior of a << b is undefined.

   For unsigned a and for signed and non-negative a, the value of a >> b
   is the integer part of a/2b
   .

   For negative a, the value of a >> b is implementation-defined (in most
   implementations, this performs arithmetic right shift, so that the
   result remains negative).
   (until C++20)

   The value of a << b is the unique value congruent to a * 2b
   modulo 2N
   where N is the number of bits in the return type (that is, bitwise left
   shift is performed and the bits that get shifted out of the destination
   type are discarded).

   The value of a >> b is a/2b
   , rounded towards negative infinity (in other words, right shift on
   signed a is arithmetic right shift).
   (since C++20)

   The type of the result is that of lhs.

Overloads

   In overload resolution against user-defined operators, for every pair
   of promoted integral types L and R, the following function signatures
   participate in overload resolution:
   L operator<<(L, R)
   L operator>>(L, R)
   Run this code
#include <iostream>

enum { ONE = 1, TWO = 2 };

int main()
{
    std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase;
    char c = 0x10;
    unsigned long long ull = 0x123;
    std::cout << "0x123 << 1 = " << (ull << 1) << "\n"
                 "0x123 << 63 = " << (ull << 63) << "\n" // overflow in unsigned
                 "0x10 << 10 = " << (c << 10) << '\n';   // char is promoted to
int
    long long ll = -1000;
    std::cout << std::dec << "-1000 >> 1 = " << (ll >> ONE) << '\n';
}

   Output:
0x123 << 1 = 0x246
0x123 << 63 = 0x8000000000000000
0x10 << 10 = 0x4000
-1000 >> 1 = -500
