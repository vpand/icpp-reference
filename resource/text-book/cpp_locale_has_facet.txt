   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class Facet >
   bool has_facet( const locale& loc ) throw();
                             (until C++11)
   template< class Facet >
   bool has_facet( const locale& loc ) noexcept;
                             (since C++11)

   Checks if the locale loc implements the facet Facet.

   The program is ill-formed if Facet is not a facet or it is a
   volatile-qualified facet.

Parameters

   loc - the locale object to query

Return value

   Returns true if the facet Facet was installed in the locale loc, false
   otherwise.

Notes

   std::has_facet must return true for all locales loc if Facet is one of
   the standard facets given here.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

// minimal custom facet
struct myfacet : public std::locale::facet
{
    static std::locale::id id;
};

std::locale::id myfacet::id;

int main()
{
    // loc is a "C" locale with myfacet added
    std::locale loc(std::locale::classic(), new myfacet);
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << "Can loc classify chars? "
              << std::has_facet<std::ctype<char>>(loc) << '\n'
              << "Can loc classify char32_t? "
              << std::has_facet<std::ctype<char32_t>>(loc) << '\n'
              << "Does loc implement myfacet? "
              << std::has_facet<myfacet>(loc) << '\n';
}

   Output:
Can loc classify chars? true
Can loc classify char32_t? false
Does loc implement myfacet? true

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 436 C++98 it was unclear whether Facet can be cv-qualified it can
   be const-qualified, but not volatile-qualified
