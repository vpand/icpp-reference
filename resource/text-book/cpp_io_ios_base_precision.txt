   streamsize precision() const;
   (1)
   streamsize precision( streamsize new_precision );
   (2)

   Manages the precision (i.e. how many digits are generated) of floating
   point output performed by std::num_put::do_put.
   1) Returns the current precision.
   2) Sets the precision to the given one. Returns the previous precision.

   The default precision, as established by std::basic_ios::init, is 6.

Parameters

   new_precision - new precision setting

Return value

   The precision before the call to the function

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    const double d = 12.345678901234;
    std::cout << "The  default precision is " << std::cout.precision() << "\n\n"
;
    std::cout << "With default precision d is " << d << '\n';
    std::cout.precision(8);
    std::cout << "With high    precision d is " << d << '\n';
}

   Output:
The  default precision is 6

With default precision d is 12.3457
With high    precision d is 12.345679

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 189 C++98 'precision' was defined as 'the number of digits after
   the decimal point', but it is not correct in some cases corrected
