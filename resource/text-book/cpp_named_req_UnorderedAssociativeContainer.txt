   Unordered associative containers are Containers that provide fast
   lookup of objects based on keys. Worst case complexity is linear but on
   average much faster for most of the operations.

   Unordered associative containers are parametrized by Key; Hash, a Hash
   function object which acts as hash function on Key; and Pred, a
   BinaryPredicate evaluating equivalence between Keys. std::unordered_map
   and std::unordered_multimap also have a mapped type T associated with
   the Key.

   If two Keys are equal according to Pred, Hash must return the same
   value for both keys.

   If both Hash::is_transparent and Pred::is_transparent exist and each
   names a type, member functions find, contains, count, equal_range, and
   bucket accept arguments of types other than Key and expect that Hash is
   callable with values of those types, and that Pred is a transparent
   comparison function such as std::equal_to<>.
   (since C++20)

   std::unordered_map and std::unordered_set can contain at most one
   element with a given key, std::unordered_multiset and
   std::unordered_multimap instead can have multiple elements with the
   same key (which must always be adjacent on iterations).

   For std::unordered_set and std::unordered_multiset the value type is
   the same as the key type and both iterator and const_iterator are
   constant iterators. For std::unordered_map and std::unordered_multimap
   the value type is std::pair<const Key, T>.

   Elements in an unordered associative container are organized into
   buckets, keys with the same hash will end up in the same bucket. The
   number of buckets is increased when the size of the container increases
   to keep the average number of elements in each bucket under a certain
   value.

   Rehashing invalidates iterator and might cause the elements to be
   re-arranged in different buckets but it doesn't invalidate references
   to the elements.

   Unordered associative containers meet the requirements of
   AllocatorAwareContainer. For std::unordered_map and
   std::unordered_multimap the requirements of value_type in
   AllocatorAwareContainer apply to key_type and mapped_type (not to
   value_type).
