   Indicates that the function does not return.

Syntax

   [[ noreturn ]]
   [[ __noreturn__ ]]
   [[ _Noreturn ]]
   [[ ___Noreturn__ ]]                (deprecated)

Explanation

   Indicates that the function does not return.

   This attribute applies to the name of the function and specifies that
   the function does not return by executing the return statement or by
   reaching the end of the function body (it may return by executing
   longjmp). The behavior is undefined if the function with this attribute
   actually returns. A compiler diagnostic is recommended if this can be
   detected.

   It has been previously denoted by the keyword _Noreturn until it was
   deprecated since C23 and replaced by this attribute.

Standard library

   The following standard functions are declared with noreturn attribute
   (they used to be declared with _Noreturn specifier until C23):
     * abort()
     * exit()
     * _Exit()
     * quick_exit()
     * thrd_exit()
     * longjmp()
