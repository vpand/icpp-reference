   constexpr std::uint_least32_t column() const noexcept;
   (library fundamentals TS v2)

   Returns an implementation-defined value representing some offset from
   the start of the line represented by this object (i.e., the column
   number).

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   An implementation-defined value representing some offset from the start
   of the line represented by this object (i.e., the column number).

Example

   Run this code
#include <experimental/source_location>
#include <iostream>

template<typename T = std::experimental::source_location>
inline void pos(const T& location = T::current())
{
    std::cout
        << "("
        << location.line()
        << ':'
        << location.column()
        << ") ";
}

int main()
{
    pos(); std::cout << "Proxima\n";
    pos(); std::cout << "Centauri\n";
}

   Possible output:
(17:5) Proxima
(18:5) Centauri
