   virtual ~basic_iostream();

   Destructs the input/output stream.

Notes

   This destructor does not perform any operation on the underlying stream
   buffer (rdbuf()): the destructors of the derived streams such as
   std::basic_fstream and std::basic_stringstream are responsible for
   calling the destructors of the stream buffers.
