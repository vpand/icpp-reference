   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/iterator>
   namespace {

       constexpr /* unspecified */ distance = /* unspecified */;
   }
   (ranges TS)
   (customization point object)
   Call signature
   template< Iterator I, Sentinel<I> S >
   constexpr ranges::difference_type_t<I> distance( I first, S last );
   (1)
   template< Range R >
   constexpr ranges::difference_type_t<ranges::iterator_t<R>> distance(
   R&& r );
   (2)
   template< SizedRange R >
   constexpr ranges::difference_type_t<ranges::iterator_t<R>> distance(
   R&& r );
   (3)

   Returns the distance between first and last, or between the beginning
   and the end of the range r.
   1) If SizedSentinel<S, I> is satisfied, equivalent to return last -
   first;. Otherwise, returns the number of increments needed to get from
   first to last. If [first, last) does not denote a range, then I and S
   must be the same type and must model SizedSentinel, and [last, first)
   must denote a range. Otherwise, the behavior is undefined.
   2) Equivalent to return ranges::distance(ranges::begin(r),
   ranges::end(r));.
   3) Equivalent to return ranges::size(r);.

   Instantiating overloads (2,3) may be ill-formed if the header
   <experimental/ranges/range> is not included before the point of
   instantiation.

Customization point objects

   The name ranges::distance denotes a customization point object, which
   is a function object of a literal Semiregular class type (denoted, for
   exposition purposes, as DistanceT). All instances of DistanceT are
   equal. Thus, ranges::distance can be copied freely and its copies can
   be used interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the
   requirements for arguments to ranges::distance above, DistanceT will
   satisfy ranges::Invocable<const DistanceT, Args...>. Otherwise, no
   function call operator of DistanceT participates in overload
   resolution.

   In every translation unit in which ranges::distance is defined, it
   refers to the same instance of the customization point object. (This
   means that it can be used freely in things like inline functions and
   function templates without violating the one-definition rule.)

Return value

   The distance between first and last, or between the beginning and the
   end of the range r.
