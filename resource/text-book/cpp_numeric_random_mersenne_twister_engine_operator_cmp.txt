   (until C++20)

   Compares two pseudo-random number engines. Two engines are equal, if
   their internal states are equivalent, that is, if they would generate
   equivalent values for any number of calls of operator().

   These functions are not visible to ordinary unqualified or qualified
   lookup, and can only be found by argument-dependent lookup when
   std::mersenne_twister_engine<UIntType,w,n,m,r,a,u,d,s,b,t,c,l,f> is an
   associated class of the arguments.

   The != operator is synthesized from operator==.
   (since C++20)

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - engines to compare

Return value

   1) true if the engines are equivalent, false otherwise.
   2) true if the engines are not equivalent, false otherwise.

Exceptions

   Throws nothing.
