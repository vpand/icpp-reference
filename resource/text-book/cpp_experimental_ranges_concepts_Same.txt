   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T, class U >
   concept bool Same = std::is_same<T, U>::value; // see below
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept Same<T, U> is satisfied if and only if T and U denote the
   same type.

   Despite being specified using it, there need not be any subsumption
   relationship between Same<T, U> and std::is_same<T, U>::value.

   For the purposes of constraint checking, Same<T, U> implies Same<U, T>.

Notes

   The additional requirement on constraint checking differentiates Same
   from std::is_same.
