   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class Facet >
   locale combine( const locale& other ) const;

   Constructs a locale object which is a copy of *this except for the
   facet of type Facet, which is copied from other.

   The program is ill-formed if Facet is not a facet or it is a
   volatile-qualified facet.

Return value

   The new, nameless, locale.

Exceptions

   std::runtime_error if other does not implement Facet.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

int main()
{
    const double number = 1000.25;
    std::cout << "\"C\" locale: " << number << '\n';
    std::locale loc = std::locale()
        .combine<std::numpunct<char>>(std::locale("en_US.UTF8"));
    std::cout.imbue(loc);
    std::cout << "\"C\" locale with en_US numpunct: " << number << '\n';
}

   Output:
"C" locale: 1000.25
"C" locale with en_US numpunct: 1,000.25

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 14 C++98 locale::combine was non-const made const
   LWG 436 C++98 it was unclear whether Facet can be cv-qualified it can
   be const-qualified, but not volatile-qualified
