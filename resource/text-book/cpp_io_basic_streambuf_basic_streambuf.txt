   protected:
   basic_streambuf();
   (1)
   protected:
   basic_streambuf(const basic_streambuf& rhs);
   (2)       (since C++11)
   1) Constructs the basic_streambuf object, initializes the six pointer
   members (eback(), gptr(), egptr(), pbase(), pptr(), and epptr()) to
   null pointer values, and the locale member to std::locale(), a copy of
   the global C++ locale at the time of construction.
   2) Constructs a copy of rhs, initializing the six pointers and the
   locale object with the copies of the values held by rhs. Note that this
   is a shallow copy: the pointers of the newly-constructed
   basic_streambuf are pointing into the same character array as the
   pointers of rhs.

   Both constructors are protected, and are only called by the concrete
   streambuf classes, such as std::basic_filebuf, std::basic_stringbuf, or
   std::strstreambuf.

Parameters

   rhs - a streambuf object to copy

Notes

   Until C++11, it was unspecified whether basic_streambuf or any of its
   derived classes is CopyConstructible (LWG issue 421), and different C++
   library implementations provided different options.
