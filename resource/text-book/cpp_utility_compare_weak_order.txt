                                       (since C++20)
   Call signature
   template< class T, class U >

       requires /* see below */
   constexpr std::weak_ordering weak_order(T&& t, U&& u) noexcept(/* see
   below */);

   Compares two values using 3-way comparison and produces a result of
   type std::weak_ordering.

   Let t and u be expressions and T and U denote decltype((t)) and
   decltype((u)) respectively, std::weak_order(t, u) is
   expression-equivalent to:
     * If std::is_same_v<std::decay_t<T>, std::decay_t<U>> is true:
          + std::weak_ordering(weak_order(t, u)), if it is a well-formed
            expression with overload resolution performed in a context
            that does not include a declaration of std::weak_order,
          + otherwise, if T is a floating-point type:
               o if std::numeric_limits<T>::is_iec559 is true, performs
                 the weak ordering comparison of floating-point values
                 (see below) and returns that result as a value of type
                 std::weak_ordering,
               o otherwise, yields a value of type std::weak_ordering that
                 is consistent with the ordering observed by T's
                 comparison operators,
          + otherwise, std::weak_ordering(std::compare_three_way()(t, u)),
            if it is well-formed,
          + otherwise, std::weak_ordering(std::strong_order(t, u)), if it
            is well-formed.
     * In all other cases, the expression is ill-formed, which can result
       in substitution failure when it appears in the immediate context of
       a template instantiation.

Customization point objects

   The name std::weak_order denotes a customization point object, which is
   a const function object of a literal semiregular class type. For
   exposition purposes, the cv-unqualified version of its type is denoted
   as __weak_order_fn.

   All instances of __weak_order_fn are equal. The effects of invoking
   different instances of type __weak_order_fn on the same arguments are
   equivalent, regardless of whether the expression denoting the instance
   is an lvalue or rvalue, and is const-qualified or not (however, a
   volatile-qualified instance is not required to be invocable). Thus,
   std::weak_order can be copied freely and its copies can be used
   interchangeably.

   Given a set of types Args..., if std::declval<Args>()... meet the
   requirements for arguments to std::weak_order above, __weak_order_fn
   models
     * std::invocable<__weak_order_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<const __weak_order_fn, Args...>,
     * std::invocable<__weak_order_fn&, Args...>, and
     * std::invocable<const __weak_order_fn&, Args...>.

   Otherwise, no function call operator of __weak_order_fn participates in
   overload resolution.

Strict weak order of IEEE floating-point types

   Let x and y be values of same IEEE floating-point type, and
   weak_order_less(x, y) be the boolean result indicating if x precedes y
   in the strict weak order defined by the C++ standard.
     * If neither x nor y is NaN, then weak_order_less(x, y) == true if
       and only if x < y, i.e. all representations of equal floating-point
       value are equivalent;
     * If x is negative NaN and y is not negative NaN, then
       weak_order_less(x, y) == true;
     * If x is not positive NaN and y is positive NaN, then
       weak_order_less(x, y) == true;
     * If both x and y are NaNs with the same sign, then
       (weak_order_less(x, y) || weak_order_less(y, x)) == false, i.e. all
       NaNs with the same sign are equivalent.
