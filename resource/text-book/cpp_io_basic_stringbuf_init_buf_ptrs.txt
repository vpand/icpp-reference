   basic_stringbuf::init_buf_ptrs

   void init_buf_ptrs();
                        (exposition only*)

   Initializes the input and output sequences from buf according to mode.
   buf and mode are exposition-only data members of *this.

   Immediately after this function returns:
     * If std::ios_base::out is set in mode, pbase() points to buf.front()
       and epptr() >= pbase() + buf.size() is true;
          + in addition, if std::ios_base::ate is set in mode, pptr() ==
            pbase() + buf.size() is true,
          + otherwise pptr() == pbase() is true.
     * If std::ios_base::in is set in mode, eback() points to buf.front(),
       and gptr() == eback() && egptr() == eback() + buf.size() is true.

Notes

   For efficiency reasons, stream buffer operations can violate invariants
   of buf while it is held encapsulated in the std::basic_stringbuf, e.g.,
   by writing to characters in the range [buf.data() +
   buf.size(), buf.data() + buf.capacity()).

   All operations retrieving a std::basic_string from buf ensure that the
   std::basic_string invariants hold on the returned value.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 1448 C++98 calling init_buf_ptrs() made
   pptr() == pbase() + buf.data()
   for streams that are both input and output streams makes
   pptr() == pbase() + buf.size()
