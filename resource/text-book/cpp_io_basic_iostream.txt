   std::basic_iostream
   Member functions
   basic_iostream::basic_iostream
   basic_iostream::~basic_iostream
   Protected member functions
   basic_iostream::operator=
   basic_iostream::swap

   Defined in header <istream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
   > class basic_iostream :
         public basic_istream<CharT, Traits>,
         public basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>

   The class template basic_iostream provides support for high level
   input/output operations on streams. The supported operations include
   sequential reading or writing and formatting. This functionality is
   implemented over the interface provided by the std::basic_streambuf
   class. It is accessed through std::basic_ios class.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 271 C++98 the member types char_type, traits_type, int_type,
   pos_type and off_type were not defined
   (std::basic_istream and std::basic_ostream both define these types,
   resulted in ambiguity) define
   these types
