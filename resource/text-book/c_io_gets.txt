   Defined in header <stdio.h>
   char *gets( char *str );
   (1)                                  (removed in C11)
   char *gets_s( char *str, rsize_t n );
   (2)                                  (since C11)
   1) Reads stdin into the character array pointed to by str until a
   newline character is found or end-of-file occurs. A null character is
   written immediately after the last character read into the array. The
   newline character is discarded but not stored in the buffer.
   2) Reads characters from stdin until a newline is found or end-of-file
   occurs. Writes only at most n-1 characters into the array pointed to by
   str, and always writes the terminating null character (unless str is a
   null pointer). The newline character, if found, is discarded and does
   not count toward the number of characters written to the buffer.

          The following errors are detected at runtime and call the
          currently installed constraint handler function:

          + n is zero
          + n is greater than RSIZE_MAX
          + str is a null pointer
          + endline or eof not encountered after storing n-1 characters to
            the buffer.

          In any case, gets_s first finishes reading and discarding the
          characters from stdin until new-line character, end-of-file
          condition, or read error before calling the constraint handler.
          As with all bounds-checked functions, gets_s only guaranteed to
          be available if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the
          implementation and if the user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to
          the integer constant 1 before including <stdio.h>.

Parameters

   str - character string to be written

Return value

   str on success, a null pointer on failure.

   If the failure has been caused by end of file condition, additionally
   sets the eof indicator (see feof()) on stdin. If the failure has been
   caused by some other error, sets the error indicator (see ferror()) on
   stdin.

Notes

   The gets() function does not perform bounds checking, therefore this
   function is extremely vulnerable to buffer-overflow attacks. It cannot
   be used safely (unless the program runs in an environment which
   restricts what can appear on stdin). For this reason, the function has
   been deprecated in the third corrigendum to the C99 standard and
   removed altogether in the C11 standard. fgets() and gets_s() are the
   recommended replacements.

   Never use gets().
