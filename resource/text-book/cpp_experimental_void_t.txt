                                               (library fundamentals TS v2)

   A utility metafunction that maps a sequence of any types to the type
   void.

Notes

   This utility metafunction is used in template metaprogramming to detect
   ill-formed types in SFINAE context. First voted into C++17 as
   std::void_t, it was later added as well to the library fundamentals TS
   as std::experimental::void_t, because it is a dependency of the
   detection idiom and the LFTS v2 is based on C++14.
