   Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>
   class monotonic_buffer_resource : public memory_resource;
   (library fundamentals TS)

   The class std::experimental::pmr::monotonic_buffer_resource is a
   special-purpose memory resource class that releases the allocated
   memory only when the resource is destroyed. It is intended for very
   fast memory allocations in situations where memory is used to build up
   a few objects and then is released all at once.

   monotonic_buffer_resource can be constructed with an initial buffer. If
   there is no initial buffer, or if the buffer is exhausted, additional
   buffers are obtained from an upstream memory resource supplied at
   construction. The size of buffers obtained follows a geometric
   progression.

   monotonic_buffer_resource is not thread-safe.

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a monotonic_buffer_resource
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   [virtual]
   destroys a monotonic_buffer_resource, releasing all allocated memory
   (virtual public member function)
   operator=
   [deleted]
   copy assignment operator is deleted. monotonic_buffer_resource is not
   copy assignable
   (public member function)

Public member functions

   release
   release all allocated memory
   (public member function)
   upstream_resource
   returns a pointer to the upstream memory resource
   (public member function)

Protected member functions

   do_allocate
   [virtual]
   allocate memory
   (virtual protected member function)
   do_deallocate
   [virtual]
   no-op
   (virtual protected member function)
   do_is_equal
   [virtual]
   compare for equality with another memory_resource
   (virtual protected member function)
