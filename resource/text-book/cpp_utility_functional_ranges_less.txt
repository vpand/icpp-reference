   struct less;
                                 (since C++20)

   Function object for performing comparisons. Deduces the parameter types
   of the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return
   type).

Nested types

Member functions

   operator()
   checks if the first argument is less than the second
   (public member function)

std::ranges::less::operator()

   template< class T, class U >
   constexpr bool operator()( T&& t, U&& u ) const;

   Given the expression std::forward<T>(t) < std::forward<U>(u) as expr:
     * If expr results in a call to built-in operator< comparing pointers,
       given the composite pointer type of t and u as P:

          + If the converted t precedes the converted u (both are of type
            P) in the implementation-defined strict total order over
            pointers, returns true, otherwise returns false.
          + If the conversion sequence from T to P or the conversion
            sequence from U to P is not equality-preserving, the behavior
            is undefined.

     * Otherwise:

          + Returns the result of expr.
          + If std::totally_ordered_with<T, U> is not modeled, the
            behavior is undefined.

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if
   std::totally_ordered_with<T, U> is satisfied.

   If there exists an expression expr1 of type T and an expression expr2
   of U, such that the comparison results of expr1 and expr2 violate
   strict total ordering (rules are defined below), the behavior is
   undefined.

   The comparison results of expr1 and expr2 follow strict total ordering
   only if exactly one of the following expressions is true:
     * std::ranges::less{}(expr1, expr2)
     * std::ranges::less{}(expr2, expr1)
     * std::ranges::equal_to{}(expr1, expr2)

Notes

   Unlike std::less, std::ranges::less requires all six comparison
   operators <, <=, >, >=, == and != to be valid (via the
   totally_ordered_with constraint).

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 3530 C++20 syntactic checks were relaxed while comparing pointers
   only semantic requirements are relaxed
