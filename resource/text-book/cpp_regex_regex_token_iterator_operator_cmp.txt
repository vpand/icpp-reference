   Checks whether *this and other are equivalent.

   Two regex token iterators are equal if:
   a) They are both end-of-sequence iterators.
   b) They are both suffix iterators and the suffixes are equal.
   c) Neither of them is end-of-sequence or suffix iterator and:

               o position == other.position
               o N == other.N
               o subs == other.subs

   1) Checks whether *this is equal to other.
   2) Checks whether *this is not equal to other.

   The != operator is synthesized from operator==.
   (since C++20)
   This section is incomplete
   Reason: Explain better. For example, subs is an exposition-only vector
   of matched sub-expressions.

Parameters

   other - another regex token iterator to compare to

Return value

   1) true if *this is equal to other, false otherwise.
   2) true if *this is not equal to other, false otherwise.
