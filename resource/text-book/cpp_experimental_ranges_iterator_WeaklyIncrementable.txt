   concept bool WeaklyIncrementable =
       Semiregular<I> &&
       requires(I i) {
           typename ranges::difference_type_t<I>;
           requires SignedIntegral<ranges::difference_type_t<I>>;
           { ++i } -> Same<I>&; /* not required to be equality preserving
   */
           i++; /* not required to be equality preserving */
       };
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept WeaklyIncrementable<I> specifies the requirements on a type
   that can be incremented (with the pre- and post-increment operators).
   The increment operations need not be equality-preserving, and the type
   need not be EqualityComparable.

   Let i be an object of type I. i is said to be incrementable if it is in
   the domain of both pre- and post-increment. WeaklyIncrementable<I> is
   satisfied only if:
     * ++i and i++ have the same domain;
     * If i is incrementable, then:
          + ++i and i++ both advance i to the next element; and
          + ++i refers to the same object as i.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

Notes

   For WeaklyIncrementable types, a equals b does not imply that ++a
   equals ++b. Algorithms on such types should be single pass and never
   attempt to pass through the same value twice.
