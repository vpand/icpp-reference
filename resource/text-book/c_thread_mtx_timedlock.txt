   Defined in header <threads.h>
   int mtx_timedlock( mtx_t *restrict mutex,
                      const struct timespec *restrict time_point );
                                            (since C11)

   Blocks the current thread until the mutex pointed to by mutex is locked
   or until the TIME_UTC based absolute calendar time point pointed to by
   time_point has been reached.

   Since this function takes an absolute time, if a duration is required,
   the calendar time point must be calculated manually.

   The behavior is undefined if the current thread has already locked the
   mutex and the mutex is not recursive.

   The behavior is undefined if the mutex does not support timeout.

   Prior calls to mtx_unlock on the same mutex synchronize-with this
   operation (if this operation succeeds), and all lock/unlock operations
   on any given mutex form a single total order (similar to the
   modification order of an atomic)

Parameters

   mutex - pointer to the mutex to lock
   time_point - pointer to the absolute calendar time until which to wait
   for the timeout

Return value

   thrd_success if successful, thrd_timedout if the timeout time has been
   reached before the mutex is locked, thrd_error if an error occurs.
