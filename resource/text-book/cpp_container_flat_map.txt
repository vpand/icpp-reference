   Defined in header <flat_map>
   template<

       class Key,
       class T,
       class Compare = std::less<Key>,
       class KeyContainer = std::vector<Key>,
       class MappedContainer = std::vector<T>
   > class flat_map;
                               (since C++23)

   The flat map is a container adaptor that gives the functionality of an
   associative container that contains key-value pairs with unique keys.
   Keys are sorted by using the comparison function Compare.

   The class template flat_map acts as a wrapper to the two underlying
   containers, passed as objects of type KeyContainer and MappedContainer
   respectively. The first container is sorted, and for each key its
   corresponding value is in the second container at the same index
   (offset). The number of elements in both containers is the same.

   Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements,
   uniqueness is determined by using the equivalence relation. Informally,
   two objects a and b are considered equivalent if neither compares less
   than the other: !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

   std::flat_map meets the requirements of Container, ReversibleContainer,
   optional container requirements, and all requirements of
   AssociativeContainer (including logarithmic search complexity), except
   that:
     * requirements related to nodes are not applicable,
     * iterator invalidation requirements differ,
     * the complexity of insertion and erasure operations is linear.

   A flat map supports most AssociativeContainer's operations that use
   unique keys.

Iterator invalidation

Template parameters

   Key - The type of the keys. The program is ill-formed if Key is not the
   same type as KeyContainer::value_type.
   T - The type of mapped values. The program is ill-formed if T is not
   the same type as MappedContainer::value_type.
   Compare - A Compare type providing a strict weak ordering.
   KeyContainer
   MappedContainer - The types of the underlying SequenceContainer to
   store keys and mapped values correspondingly. The iterators of such
   containers should satisfy LegacyRandomAccessIterator or model
   random_access_iterator. Invocations of their member functions size and
   max_size should not exit via an exception.

   The standard containers std::vector and std::deque satisfy these
   requirements.

Deduction guides

Notes

   The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same
   type. This means defining a pair of function overloads using the two
   types as parameter types may violate the One Definition Rule. Since
   iterator is convertible to const_iterator, a single function with a
   const_iterator as parameter type will work instead.
