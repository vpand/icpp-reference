   Defined in header <map>

       class Key,

       template<

       > using multimap = std::multimap<Key, T, Compare,
           std::pmr::polymorphic_allocator<std::pair<const Key, T>>>;
   }

   std::multimap is an associative container that contains a sorted list
   of key-value pairs, while permitting multiple entries with the same
   key. Sorting is done according to the comparison function Compare,
   applied to the keys. Search, insertion, and removal operations have
   logarithmic complexity.

   Iterators of std::multimap iterate in non-descending order of keys,
   where non-descending is defined by the comparison that was used for
   construction. That is, given
     * m, a std::multimap
     * it_l and it_r, dereferenceable iterators to m, with it_l < it_r.

   m.value_comp()(*it_r, *it_l) == false (least to greatest if using the
   default comparison).

   The order of the key-value pairs whose keys compare equivalent is the
   order of insertion and does not change.
   (since C++11)

   Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements,
   equivalence is determined by using the equivalence relation as
   described on Compare. In imprecise terms, two objects a and b are
   considered equivalent if neither compares less than the other: !comp(a,
   b) && !comp(b, a).

   std::multimap meets the requirements of Container,
   AllocatorAwareContainer, AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.
