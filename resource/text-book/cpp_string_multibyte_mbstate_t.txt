   mbstate_t

   Defined in header <cuchar>
                             (since C++17)
   Defined in header <cwchar>
   struct mbstate_t;

   The type mbstate_t is a trivial non-array type that can represent any
   of the conversion states that can occur in an implementation-defined
   set of supported multibyte character encoding rules. Zero-initialized
   value of mbstate_t represents the initial conversion state, although
   other values of mbstate_t may exist that also represent the initial
   conversion state.

   Possible implementation of mbstate_t is a struct type holding an array
   representing the incomplete multibyte character, an integer counter
   indicating the number of bytes in the array that have been processed,
   and a representation of the current shift state.

   The following functions should not be called from multiple threads
   without synchronization with the std::mbstate_t* argument of a null
   pointer due to possible data races: std::mbrlen, std::mbrtowc,
   std::mbsrtowcs, std::mbtowc, std::wcrtomb, std::wcsrtombs, std::wctomb.
