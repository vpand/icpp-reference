   iostate rdstate() const;

   Returns the current stream error state.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   current stream error state. It is a bitmask type and can be a
   combination of the following constants:
   Constant Explanation
   goodbit  no error
   badbit   irrecoverable stream error
   failbit  input/output operation failed (formatting or extraction error)
   eofbit   associated input sequence has reached end-of-file

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::ostringstream stream;

    if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::goodbit)
        std::cout << "stream state is goodbit\n";

    stream.setstate(std::ios_base::eofbit);

    // check state is exactly eofbit (no failbit and no badbit)
    if (stream.rdstate() == std::ios_base::eofbit)
        std::cout << "stream state is eofbit\n";
}

   Output:
stream state is goodbit
stream state is eofbit
