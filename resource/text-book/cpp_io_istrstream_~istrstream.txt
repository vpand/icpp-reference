   std::istrstream
   Member functions
   istrstream::istrstream
   istrstream::~istrstream
   istrstream::rdbuf
   istrstream::str

   virtual ~istrstream();
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   Destroys a std::istrstream object, which also destroys the member
   std::strstreambuf.

Parameters

   (none)

Notes

   The constructors of std::istrstream do not create the underlying
   std::strstreambuf in dynamically allocated mode, so the memory leaks
   that are possible with std::ostrstream::~ostrstream or
   std::strstream::~strstream do not apply.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    {
        std::istrstream s("1.234");
        double d;
        s >> d;
        std::cout << d << '\n';
    } // destructor called
}

   Output:
1.234
