   Defined in header <filesystem>
   class path;
                                 (since C++17)

   Objects of type path represent paths on a filesystem. Only syntactic
   aspects of paths are handled: the pathname may represent a non-existing
   path or even one that is not allowed to exist on the current file
   system or OS.

   The path name has the following syntax:
    1. root-name(optional): identifies the root on a filesystem with
       multiple roots (such as "C:" or "//myserver"). In case of
       ambiguity, the longest sequence of characters that forms a valid
       root-name is treated as the root-name. The standard library may
       define additional root-names besides the ones understood by the OS
       API.
    2. root-directory(optional): a directory separator that, if present,
       marks this path as absolute. If it is missing (and the first
       element other than the root name is a file name), then the path is
       relative and requires another path as the starting location to
       resolve to a file name.
    3. Zero or more of the following:

          + file-name: sequence of characters that aren't directory
            separators or preferred directory separators (additional
            limitations may be imposed by the OS or file system). This
            name may identify a file, a hard link, a symbolic link, or a
            directory. Two special file-names are recognized:

               o dot: the file name consisting of a single dot character .
                 is a directory name that refers to the current directory.
               o dot-dot: the file name consisting of two dot characters
                 .. is a directory name that refers to the parent
                 directory.

          + directory-separators: the forward slash character / or the
            alternative character provided as path::preferred_separator.
            If this character is repeated, it is treated as a single
            directory separator: /usr///////lib is the same as /usr/lib.

   A path can be normalized by following this algorithm:
    1. If the path is empty, stop (normal form of an empty path is an
       empty path).
    2. Replace each directory-separator (which may consist of multiple
       slashes) with a single path::preferred_separator.
    3. Replace each slash character in the root-name with
       path::preferred_separator.
    4. Remove each dot and any immediately following directory-separator.
    5. Remove each non-dot-dot filename immediately followed by a
       directory-separator and a dot-dot, along with any immediately
       following directory-separator.
    6. If there is root-directory, remove all dot-dots and any
       directory-separators immediately following them.
    7. If the last filename is dot-dot, remove any trailing
       directory-separator.
    8. If the path is empty, add a dot (normal form of ./ is .).

   The path can be traversed element-wise via iterators returned by the
   begin() and end() functions, which views the path in generic format and
   iterates over root name, root directory, and the subsequent file name
   elements (directory separators are skipped except the one that
   identifies the root directory). If the very last element in the path is
   a directory separator, the last iterator will dereference to an empty
   element.

   Calling any non-const member function of a path invalidates all
   iterators referring to elements of that object.

   If the OS uses a native syntax that is different from the portable
   generic syntax described above, library functions that are defined to
   accept "detected format" accept path names in both formats: a detected
   format argument is taken to be in the generic format if and only if it
   matches the generic format but is not acceptable to the operating
   system as a native path. On those OS where native format differs
   between pathnames of directories and pathnames of files, a generic
   pathname is treated as a directory path if it ends on a directory
   separator and a regular file otherwise.

   In any case, the path class behaves as if it stores a pathname in the
   native format and automatically converts to generic format as needed
   (each member function specifies which format it interprets the path
   as).

   On POSIX systems, the generic format is the native format and there is
   no need to distinguish or convert between them.

   Paths are implicitly convertible to and from std::basic_strings, which
   makes it possible to use them with other file APIs.

   The stream operators use std::quoted so that spaces do not cause
   truncation when later read by stream input operator.

   Decomposition member functions (e.g. extension) return filesystem::path
   objects instead of string objects as other APIs do.

Member types and constants

   Type Definition
   value_type character type used by the native encoding of the
   filesystem: char on POSIX, wchar_t on Windows
   string_type std::basic_string<value_type>
   const_iterator a constant LegacyInputIterator with a value_type of path
   that meets all requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator except that
   for two equal dereferenceable iterators a and b of type const_iterator,
   there is no requirement that *a and *b refer to the same object.

   It is unspecified whether const_iterator is actually a
   LegacyBidirectionalIterator
   iterator an alias to const_iterator
   format
   (C++17)
   determines how to interpret string representations of pathnames.

   The following enumerators are also defined:
