   Eager execution

   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto on(

       execution::scheduler auto sched,
       execution::sender auto snd
   );
                                (since C++26)

Parameters

   sched - provides execution agent on which the sender will be executed
   snd - work to be executed on the execution resource associated with
   sched

Return value

   Returns a sender which, when started, will start the provided sender on
   an execution agent belonging to the execution resource associated with
   the provided scheduler.

   The returned sender has no completion schedulers.
