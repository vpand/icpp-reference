   Defined in header <ios>
   const std::error_category& iostream_category() noexcept;
                                                           (since C++11)

   Obtains a reference to the static error category object for iostream
   errors. The object is required to override the virtual function
   error_category::name() to return a pointer to the string "iostream". It
   is used to identify error codes provided in the exceptions of type
   std::ios_base::failure.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   A reference to the static object of unspecified runtime type, derived
   from std::error_category.

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::ifstream f("doesn't exist");
    try
    {
        f.exceptions(f.failbit);
    }
    catch (const std::ios_base::failure& e)
    {
        std::cout << "Caught an ios_base::failure.\n"
                  << "Error code: " << e.code().value()
                  << " (" << e.code().message() << ")\n"
                  << "Error category: " << e.code().category().name() << '\n';

    }
}

   Possible output:
Caught an ios_base::failure.
Error code: 1 (unspecified iostream_category error)
Error category: iostream
