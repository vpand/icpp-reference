   Defined in header <cwctype>
   std::wctrans_t wctrans( const char* str );

   Constructs a value of type std::wctrans_t that describes a LC_CTYPE
   category of wide character mapping. It may be one of the standard
   mappings, or a locale-specific mapping, such as "tojhira" or "tojkata".

Parameters

   str - C string holding the name of the desired mapping.

   The following values of str are supported in all C locales:
   Value of str Effect
   "toupper"    identifies the mapping used by towupper
   "tolower"    identifies the mapping used by towlower

Return value

   std::wctrans_t object suitable for use with std::towctrans to map wide
   characters according to the named mapping of the current C locale or
   zero if str does not name a mapping supported by the current C locale.
