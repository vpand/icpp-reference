   Defined in header <exception>
   std::unexpected_handler get_unexpected() noexcept;
   (since C++11)
   (deprecated)
   (removed in C++17)

   Returns the currently installed std::unexpected_handler, which may be a
   null pointer.

   This function is thread-safe. Prior call to std::set_unexpected
   synchronizes-with (see std::memory_order) the subsequent calls to this
   function.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The currently installed std::unexpected_handler.
