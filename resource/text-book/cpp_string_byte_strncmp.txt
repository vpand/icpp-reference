   Defined in header <cstring>
   int strncmp( const char* lhs, const char* rhs, std::size_t count );

   Compares at most count characters of two possibly null-terminated
   arrays. The comparison is done lexicographically. Characters following
   the null character are not compared.

   The sign of the result is the sign of the difference between the values
   of the first pair of characters (both interpreted as unsigned char)
   that differ in the arrays being compared.

   The behavior is undefined when access occurs past the end of either
   array lhs or rhs. The behavior is undefined when either lhs or rhs is
   the null pointer.

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - pointers to the possibly null-terminated arrays to compare
   count    - maximum number of characters to compare

Return value

   Negative value if lhs appears before rhs in lexicographical order.

   Zero if lhs and rhs compare equal, or if count is zero.

   Positive value if lhs appears after rhs in lexicographical order.

Notes

   This function is not locale-sensitive, unlike std::strcoll and
   std::strxfrm.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

void demo(const char* lhs, const char* rhs, int sz)
{
    const int rc = std::strncmp(lhs, rhs, sz);
    if (rc < 0)
        std::cout << "First " << sz << " chars of ["
                  << lhs << "] precede [" << rhs << "]\n";
    else if (rc > 0)
        std::cout << "First " << sz << " chars of ["
                  << lhs << "] follow [" << rhs << "]\n";
    else
        std::cout << "First " << sz << " chars of ["
                  << lhs << "] equal [" << rhs << "]\n";
}

int main()
{
    demo("Hello, world!", "Hello, everybody!", 13);
    demo("Hello, everybody!", "Hello, world!", 13);
    demo("Hello, everybody!", "Hello, world!", 7);
    demo("Hello, everybody!" + 12, "Hello, somebody!" + 11, 5);
}

   Output:
First 13 chars of [Hello, world!] follow [Hello, everybody!]
First 13 chars of [Hello, everybody!] precede [Hello, world!]
First 7 chars of [Hello, everybody!] equal [Hello, world!]
First 5 chars of [body!] equal [body!]
