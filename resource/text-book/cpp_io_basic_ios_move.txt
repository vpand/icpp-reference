   protected:
   void move( basic_ios& other );
             (since C++11)
   protected:
   void move( basic_ios&& other );
             (since C++11)

   Replaces the current state with that of other, except for the
   associated rdbuf. other is in valid, but unspecified state after the
   call. After the call to this function, rdbuf() returns a null pointer,
   other.rdbuf() returns the same value as before the call, and
   other.tie() returns a null pointer.

   This member function is protected: it is called by the protected move
   constructors of the derived stream classes std::basic_ostream and
   std::basic_istream, which, in turn, are called by the public move
   constructors of the further derived stream classes such as
   std::basic_ofstream, which know how to correctly move the associated
   streambuffer.

Parameters

   other - the basic_ios object to transfer the state from

Return value

   (none)

   (C++11)
