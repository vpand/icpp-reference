   Defined in header <iostream>
   extern std::istream cin;
   (1)
   extern std::wistream wcin;
   (2)

   The global objects std::cin and std::wcin control input from a stream
   buffer of implementation-defined type (derived from std::streambuf),
   associated with the standard C input stream stdin.

   These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the
   first time an object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are
   available for use in the constructors and destructors of static objects
   with ordered initialization (as long as <iostream> is included before
   the object is defined).

   Unless sync_with_stdio(false) has been issued, it is safe to
   concurrently access these objects from multiple threads for both
   formatted and unformatted input.

   Once std::cin is constructed, std::cin.tie() returns &std::cout, and
   likewise, std::wcin.tie() returns &std::wcout. This means that any
   formatted input operation on std::cin forces a call to
   std::cout.flush() if any characters are pending for output.

Notes

   The 'c' in the name refers to "character" (stroustrup.com FAQ); cin
   means "character input" and wcin means "wide character input".

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>

struct Foo
{
    int n;
    Foo()
    {
        std::cout << "Enter n: "; // no flush needed
        std::cin >> n;
    }
};

Foo f; // static object

int main()
{
    std::cout << "f.n is " << f.n << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
Enter n: 10
f.n is 10
