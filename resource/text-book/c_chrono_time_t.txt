   Defined in header <time.h>
   typedef /* unspecified */ time_t;

   Real arithmetic type capable of representing times.

   Although not defined by the C standard, this is almost always an
   integral value holding the number of seconds (not counting leap
   seconds) since 00:00, Jan 1 1970 UTC, corresponding to POSIX time.

Notes

   The standard uses the term calendar time when referring to a value of
   type time_t.

Example

   Show the start of the epoch.
   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <stdint.h>

int main(void)
{
    time_t epoch = 0;
    printf("%jd seconds since the epoch began\n", (intmax_t)epoch);
    printf("%s", asctime(gmtime(&epoch)));
}

   Possible output:
0 seconds since the epoch began
Thu Jan  1 00:00:00 1970
