   Defined in header <locale.h>
   struct lconv;

   The struct lconv contains numeric and monetary formatting rules as
   defined by a C locale. Objects of this struct may be obtained with
   localeconv. The members of lconv are values of type char and of type
   char*. Each char* member except decimal_point may be pointing at a null
   character (that is, at an empty C-string). The members of type char are
   all non-negative numbers, any of which may be CHAR_MAX if the
   corresponding value is not available in the current C locale.

Member objects

Non-monetary numeric formatting parameters

   char* decimal_point
   the character used as the decimal point
   (public member object)
   char* thousands_sep
   the character used to separate groups of digits before the decimal
   point
   (public member object)
   char* grouping
   a string whose elements indicate the sizes of digit groups
   (public member object)

Monetary numeric formatting parameters

   char* mon_decimal_point
   the character used as the decimal point
   (public member object)
   char* mon_thousands_sep
   the character used to separate groups of digits before the decimal
   point
   (public member object)
   char* mon_grouping
   a string whose elements indicate the sizes of digit groups
   (public member object)
   char* positive_sign
   a string used to indicate non-negative monetary quantity
   (public member object)
   char* negative_sign
   a string used to indicate negative monetary quantity
   (public member object)

Local monetary numeric formatting parameters

   char* currency_symbol
   the symbol used for currency in the current C locale
   (public member object)
   char frac_digits
   the number of digits after the decimal point to display in a monetary
   quantity
   (public member object)
   char p_cs_precedes
   1 if currency_symbol is placed before non-negative value, 0 if after
   (public member object)
   char n_cs_precedes
   1 if currency_symbol is placed before negative value, 0 if after
   (public member object)
   char p_sep_by_space
   indicates the separation of currency_symbol, positive_sign, and the
   non-negative monetary value
   (public member object)
   char n_sep_by_space
   indicates the separation of currency_symbol, negative_sign, and the
   negative monetary value
   (public member object)
   char p_sign_posn
   indicates the position of positive_sign in a non-negative monetary
   value
   (public member object)
   char n_sign_posn
   indicates the position of negative_sign in a negative monetary value
   (public member object)

International monetary numeric formatting parameters

   char* int_curr_symbol
   the string used as international currency name in the current C locale
   (public member object)
   char int_frac_digits
   the number of digits after the decimal point to display in an
   international monetary quantity
   (public member object)
   char int_p_cs_precedes
   (C99)
   1 if int_curr_symbol is placed before non-negative international
   monetary value, 0 if after
   (public member object)
   char int_n_cs_precedes
   (C99)
   1 if int_curr_symbol is placed before negative international monetary
   value, 0 if after
   (public member object)
   char int_p_sep_by_space
   (C99)
   indicates the separation of int_curr_symbol, positive_sign, and the
   non-negative international monetary value
   (public member object)
   char int_n_sep_by_space
   (C99)
   indicates the separation of int_curr_symbol, negative_sign, and the
   negative international monetary value
   (public member object)
   char int_p_sign_posn
   (C99)
   indicates the position of positive_sign in a non-negative international
   monetary value
   (public member object)
   char int_n_sign_posn
   (C99)
   indicates the position of negative_sign in a negative international
   monetary value
   (public member object)

   The characters of the C-strings pointed to by grouping and mon_grouping
   are interpreted according to their numeric values. When the terminating
   '\0' is encountered, the last value seen is assumed to repeat for the
   remainder of digits. If CHAR_MAX is encountered, no further digits are
   grouped. The typical grouping of three digits at a time is "\003".

   The values of p_sep_by_space, n_sep_by_space, int_p_sep_by_space,
   int_n_sep_by_space are interpreted as follows:
   0 no space separates the currency symbol and the value
   1 sign sticks to the currency symbol, value is separated by a space
   2 sign sticks to the value. Currency symbol is separated by a space

   The values of p_sign_posn, n_sign_posn, int_p_sign_posn,
   int_n_sign_posn are interpreted as follows:
   0 parentheses around the value and the currency symbol are used to
   represent the sign
   1 sign before the value and the currency symbol
   2 sign after the value and the currency symbol
   3 sign before the currency symbol
   4 sign after the currency symbol

Example

   Run this code
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    setlocale(LC_ALL, "ja_JP.UTF-8");
    struct lconv *lc = localeconv();
    printf("Japanese currency symbol: %s(%s)\n", lc->currency_symbol, lc->int_cu
rr_symbol);
}

   Possible output:
Japanese currency symbol: ¥(JPY )
