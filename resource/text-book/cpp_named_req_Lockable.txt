   The Lockable requirements extends the BasicLockable requirements to
   include attempted locking.

Requirements

     * BasicLockable

   For type L to be Lockable, it must meet the above condition as well as
   the following:
   Expression Effects Return value
   m.try_lock() Attempts to acquire the lock for the current execution
   agent (thread, process, task) without blocking. If an exception is
   thrown, no lock is obtained. true if the lock was acquired, false
   otherwise

Notes

   The try_lock member functions obtains a non-shared lock on m on
   succcess.
