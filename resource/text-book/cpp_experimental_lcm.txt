   Defined in header <experimental/numeric>
   template< class M, class N >
   constexpr std::common_type_t<M, N> lcm( M m, N n );
                                           (library fundamentals TS v2)

   Computes the least common multiple of the integers m and n.

Parameters

   m, n - integer values

Return value

   If either m or n is zero, returns zero. Otherwise, return the least
   common multiple of |m| and |n|.

Remarks

   If either M or N is not an integer type, or if either is (possibly
   cv-qualified) bool, the program is ill-formed.

   The behavior is undefined if |m|, |n| or the least common multiple of
   |m| and |n| is not representable as a value of type
   std::common_type_t<M, N>.

Exceptions

   Throws no exceptions.
