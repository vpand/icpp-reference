   int_type peek();

   Behaves as UnformattedInputFunction. After constructing and testing the
   sentry object, reads the next character from the input stream without
   extracting it.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   If good() == true, returns the next character as obtained by
   rdbuf()->sgetc().

   Otherwise, returns Traits::eof().

Exceptions

   failure if an error occurred (the error state flag is not goodbit) and
   exceptions() is set to throw for that state.

   If an internal operation throws an exception, it is caught and badbit
   is set. If exceptions() is set for badbit, the exception is rethrown.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::istringstream s1("Hello, world.");
    char c1 = s1.peek();
    char c2 = s1.get();
    std::cout << "Peeked: " << c1 << " got: " << c2 << '\n';
}

   Output:
Peeked: H got: H
