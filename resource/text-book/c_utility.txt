   C includes a variety of utility libraries. These libraries can be
   broadly divided into two groups:
     * language support libraries, and
     * general-purpose libraries.

Language support

   Language support libraries provide functions that interact closely with
   language features and support common language idioms.

Type support

   Basic types (e.g. size_t, NULL)

Dynamic memory management

   (e.g. malloc)

Error handling

   Assertions (e.g. assert)

Variadic functions

   Support for functions that take an arbitrary number of parameters (via
   e.g. va_start, va_arg, va_end)

General-purpose utilities

Program utilities

   Termination (e.g. abort, atexit), environment (e.g. system), signals
   (e.g. raise)

Date and time

   Time tracking (e.g. time, clock)
