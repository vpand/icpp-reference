   long& iword( int index );

   First, allocates or resizes the private storage (dynamic array of long
   or another indexable data structure) sufficiently to make index a valid
   index, then returns a reference to the long element of the private
   storage with the index index.

   The reference may be invalidated by any operation on this ios_base
   object, including another call to iword(), but the stored values are
   retained, so that reading from iword(index) with the same index later
   will produce the same value until the next call to
   std::basic_ios::copyfmt(). The value can be used for any purpose. The
   index of the element must be obtained by a previous call to xalloc(),
   otherwise the behavior is undefined. New elements are initialized to 0.

   If the function fails (possibly caused by an allocation failure) and
   *this is a base class subobject of a basic_ios<> object or subobject,
   calls std::basic_ios<>::setstate(badbit) which may throw
   std::ios_base::failure.

Notes

   Typical use of iword storage is to pass information (e.g. custom
   formatting flags) from user-defined I/O manipulators to user-defined
   operator<< and operator>> or to user-defined formatting facets imbued
   into standard streams.

Parameters

   index - index value of the element

Return value

   A reference to the element.

Exceptions

   May throw std::ios_base::failure when setting the badbit.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

struct Foo
{
    static int foo_xalloc;
    std::string data;

    Foo(const std::string& s) : data(s) {}
};

// Allocates the iword storage for use with Foo objects
int Foo::foo_xalloc = std::ios_base::xalloc();

// This user-defined operator<< prints the string in reverse if the iword holds
1
std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, Foo& f)
{
    if (os.iword(Foo::foo_xalloc) == 1)
        return os << std::string(f.data.rbegin(), f.data.rend());
    else
        return os << f.data;
}

// This I/O manipulator flips the number stored in iword between 0 and 1
std::ios_base& rev(std::ios_base& os)
{
    os.iword(Foo::foo_xalloc) = !os.iword(Foo::foo_xalloc);
    return os;
}

int main()
{
    Foo f("example");
    std::cout << f << '\n' << rev << f << '\n' << rev << f << '\n';
}

   Output:

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 36 C++98 the stored value might not be
   retained if the reference is invalidated the stored value is retained
   until the next call of copyfmt()
   LWG 41 C++98 the function set badbit by itself on failure,
   but ios_base does not provide such interface badbit is set by basic_ios
   (if *this is its base class subobject)
