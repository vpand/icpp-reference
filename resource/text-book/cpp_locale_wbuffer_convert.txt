   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class Codecvt,
       class Elem = wchar_t,
       class Tr = std::char_traits<Elem>
   > class wbuffer_convert : public std::basic_streambuf<Elem, Tr>
   (since C++11)
   (deprecated in C++17)
   (removed in C++26)

   std::wbuffer_convert is a wrapper over stream buffer of type
   std::basic_streambuf<char> which gives it the appearance of
   std::basic_streambuf<Elem>. All I/O performed through
   std::wbuffer_convert undergoes character conversion as defined by the
   facet Codecvt. std::wbuffer_convert assumes ownership of the conversion
   facet, and cannot use a facet managed by a locale. The standard facets
   suitable for use with std::wbuffer_convert are std::codecvt_utf8 for
   UTF-8/UCS-2 and UTF-8/UCS-4 conversions and std::codecvt_utf8_utf16 for
   UTF-8/UTF-16 conversions.

   This class template makes the implicit character conversion
   functionality of std::basic_filebuf available for any
   std::basic_streambuf.
