   Defined in header <threads.h>
   #define thread_local _Thread_local
   (since C11)
   (removed in C23)

   Convenience macro which can be used to specify that an object has
   thread-local storage duration.

Notes

   Since C23, thread_local is itself a keyword, which may also be a
   predefined macro, so <threads.h> no longer provides it.
