   (since C++23)

   Specifies available file open flags. It is a BitmaskType, the following
   constants are defined:
   Constant          Explanation
   app               seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary            open in binary mode
   in                open for reading
   out               open for writing
   trunc             discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate               seek to the end of stream immediately after open
   noreplace (C++23) open in exclusive mode

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    const char* fname = "unique_name.txt";

    // write to a temporary stream object
    std::fstream(fname, std::ios::out | std::ios::trunc) << "Hi";

    std::string s;
    std::fstream(fname, std::ios::in) >> s;
    std::cout << s << '\n';
}

   Output:
Hi
