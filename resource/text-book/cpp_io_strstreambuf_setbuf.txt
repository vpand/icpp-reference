   protected:
   virtual streambuf* setbuf( char* s, std::streamsize n );
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   If s is a null pointer and n is zero, this function has no effect.

   Otherwise, the effect is implementation-defined: some implementations
   do nothing, while some implementations deallocate the dynamic member
   array used as the buffer and begin using the user-supplied character
   array of size n, whose first element is pointed to by s.

   This function is protected virtual, it may only be called through
   pubsetbuf() or from member functions of a user-defined class derived
   from std::strstreambuf.

Parameters

   s - pointer to the first byte in the user-provided buffer
   n - the number of bytes in the user-provided buffer

Return value

   this

Example

   Implementation test to check if setbuf() is supported on a dynamic
   strstream (output obtained with Sun Studio):
   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    char a[100] = {};
    std::strstream str;
    str.rdbuf()->pubsetbuf(a, sizeof a);
    str << "Test string" << std::ends;
    std::cout << "user-provided buffer holds \"" << a << "\"\n";
}

   Possible output:
user-provided buffer holds "Test string"

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 66 C++98 the effect of setbuf() was "performs an operation that is
   defined separately for each class derived from strstreambuf",
   but there are no classes derived from strstreambuf the effect is
   implementation-defined
