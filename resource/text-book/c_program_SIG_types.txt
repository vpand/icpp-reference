   Defined in header <signal.h>
   #define SIGTERM /*implementation defined*/
   #define SIGSEGV /*implementation defined*/
   #define SIGINT /*implementation defined*/
   #define SIGILL /*implementation defined*/
   #define SIGABRT /*implementation defined*/
   #define SIGFPE /*implementation defined*/

   Each of the above macro constants expands to an integer constant
   expression with distinct values, which represent different signals sent
   to the program.
   Constant Explanation
   SIGTERM  termination request, sent to the program
   SIGSEGV  invalid memory access (segmentation fault)
   SIGINT   external interrupt, usually initiated by the user
   SIGILL   invalid program image, such as invalid instruction
   SIGABRT  abnormal termination condition, as is e.g. initiated by abort()
   SIGFPE   erroneous arithmetic operation such as divide by zero
