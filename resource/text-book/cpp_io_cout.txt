   Defined in header <iostream>
   extern std::ostream cout;
   (1)
   extern std::wostream wcout;
   (2)

   The global objects std::cout and std::wcout control output to a stream
   buffer of implementation-defined type (derived from std::streambuf),
   associated with the standard C output stream stdout.

   These objects are guaranteed to be initialized during or before the
   first time an object of type std::ios_base::Init is constructed and are
   available for use in the constructors and destructors of static objects
   with ordered initialization (as long as <iostream> is included before
   the object is defined).

   Unless std::ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false) has been issued, it is
   safe to concurrently access these objects from multiple threads for
   both formatted and unformatted output.

   By specification of std::cin, std::cin.tie() returns &std::cout. This
   means that any input operation on std::cin executes std::cout.flush()
   (via std::basic_istream::sentry's constructor). Similarly,
   std::wcin.tie() returns &std::wcout.

   By specification of std::cerr, std::cerr.tie() returns &std::cout. This
   means that any output operation on std::cerr executes std::cout.flush()
   (via std::basic_ostream::sentry's constructor). Similarly,
   std::wcerr.tie() returns &std::wcout. (since C++11)

Notes

   The 'c' in the name refers to "character" (stroustrup.com FAQ); cout
   means "character output" and wcout means "wide character output".

   Because dynamic initialization of templated variables are unordered, it
   is not guaranteed that std::cout has been initialized to a usable state
   before the initialization of such variables begins, unless an object of
   type std::ios_base::Init has been constructed.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>

struct Foo
{
    int n;
    Foo()
    {
        std::cout << "static constructor\n";
    }
    ~Foo()
    {
        std::cout << "static destructor\n";
    }
};

Foo f; // static object

int main()
{
    std::cout << "main function\n";
}

   Output:
static constructor
main function
static destructor
