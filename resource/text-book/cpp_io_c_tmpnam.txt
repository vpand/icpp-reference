   tmpnam

   Defined in header <cstdio>
   char* tmpnam( char* filename );

   Creates a unique filename that does not name a currently existing file,
   and stores it in the character string pointed to by filename. The
   function is capable of generating up to TMP_MAX of unique filenames,
   but some or all of them may already be in use, and thus not suitable
   return values.

   std::tmpnam modifies static state and is not required to be
   thread-safe.

Parameters

   filename - pointer to the character array capable of holding at least
   L_tmpnam bytes, to be used as a result buffer. If a null pointer is
   passed, a pointer to an internal static buffer is returned

Return value

   filename if filename was not a null pointer. Otherwise a pointer to an
   internal static buffer is returned. If no suitable filename can be
   generated, a null pointer is returned.

Notes

   Although the names generated by std::tmpnam are difficult to guess, it
   is possible that a file with that name is created by another process
   between the moment std::tmpnam returns and the moment this program
   attempts to use the returned name to create a file. The standard
   function std::tmpfile and the POSIX function mkstemp do not have this
   problem (creating a unique directory using only the standard C library
   still requires the use of tmpnam).

   POSIX systems additionally define the similarly named function tempnam,
   which offers the choice of a directory (which defaults to the
   optionally defined macro P_tmpdir).

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string name1 = std::tmpnam(nullptr);
    std::cout << "temporary file name: " << name1 << '\n';

    char name2[L_tmpnam];
    if (std::tmpnam(name2))
        std::cout << "temporary file name: " << name2 << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
temporary file name: /tmp/fileDjwifs
temporary file name: /tmp/fileEv2bfW
