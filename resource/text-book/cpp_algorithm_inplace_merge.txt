   void inplace_merge( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                       BidirIt first, BidirIt middle, BidirIt last );
   (2) (since C++17)
   template< class BidirIt, class Compare >

   void inplace_merge( BidirIt first, BidirIt middle, BidirIt last,
                       Compare comp );
   (3) (constexpr since C++26)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class BidirIt, class Compare >

   void inplace_merge( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                       BidirIt first, BidirIt middle, BidirIt last,
                       Compare comp );
   (4) (since C++17)

   Merges two consecutive sorted ranges [first, middle) and [middle, last)
   into one sorted range [first, last).
   1) If [first, middle) or [middle, last) is not sorted with respect to
   operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20), the behavior is
   undefined.
   3) If [first, middle) or [middle, last) is not sorted with respect to
   comp, the behavior is undefined.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

   This merge function is stable, which means that for equivalent elements
   in the original two ranges, the elements from the first range
   (preserving their original order) precede the elements from the second
   range (preserving their original order).

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * [first, middle) or [middle, last) is not a valid range.
     * The output range overlaps with [first, middle) or [middle, last).

     * The type of *first is not Swappable.

   (until C++11)
     * BiditIt is not ValueSwappable.
     * The type of *first is not MoveConstructible.
     * The type of *first is not MoveAssignable.

   (since C++11)

Parameters

   first - the beginning of the first sorted range
   middle - the end of the first sorted range and the beginning of the
   second
   last - the end of the second sorted range
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
   requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
   less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

   bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

   While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not
   modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values
   of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
   (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is
   equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type BidirIt
   can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   BidirIt must meet the requirements of LegacyBidirectionalIterator.
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):
   1) Exactly \(\scriptsize N-1\)N-1 comparisons using operator<(until
   C++20)std::less{}(since C++20) if enough additional memory is
   available, \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N  log(N)) comparisons
   otherwise.
   2) \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N  log(N)) comparisons using
   operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   3) Exactly \(\scriptsize N-1\)N-1 applications of the comparison
   function comp if enough additional memory is available, \(\scriptsize
   O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N  log(N)) applications otherwise.
   4) \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N  log(N)) applications of the
   comparison function comp.

Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Possible implementation

   See the implementations in libstdc++ and libc++.

Notes

   This function attempts to allocate a temporary buffer. If the
   allocation fails, the less efficient algorithm is chosen.

Example

   The following code is an implementation of merge sort.
   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

template<class Iter>
void merge_sort(Iter first, Iter last)
{
    if (last - first > 1)
    {
        Iter middle = first + (last - first) / 2;
        merge_sort(first, middle);
        merge_sort(middle, last);
        std::inplace_merge(first, middle, last);
    }
}

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{8, 2, -2, 0, 11, 11, 1, 7, 3};
    merge_sort(v.begin(), v.end());
    for (const auto& n : v)
        std::cout << n << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Output:
-2 0 1 2 3 7 8 11 11
