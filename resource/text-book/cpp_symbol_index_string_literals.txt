   This page tries to list all the symbols that are available from the
   standard library in the namespace std::literals::string_literals. The
   symbols are written as follows:
     * Function names with ().
     * Templates with <>.

Notes

   These operators are declared in the namespace
   std::literals::string_literals, where both literals and string_literals
   are inline namespaces. Access to these operators can be gained with:
     * using namespace std::literals,
     * using namespace std::string_literals, or
     * using namespace std::literals::string_literals.

   std::chrono::duration also defines operator""s to represent literal
   seconds, but it is an arithmetic literal: 10.0s and 10s are ten
   seconds, but "10"s is a string.
