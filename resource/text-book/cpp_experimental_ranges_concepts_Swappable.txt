   The concept Swappable<T> specifies that lvalues of type T are
   swappable.

   The concept SwappableWith<T, U> specifies that expressions of the type
   and value category encoded by T and U are swappable with each other.
   SwappableWith<T, U> is satisfied only if a call to ranges::swap(t, u)
   exchanges the value of t and u, that is, given distinct objects t2
   equal to t and u2 equal to u, after evaluating either ranges::swap(t,
   u) or ranges::swap(u, t), t2 is equal to u and u2 is equal to t.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.
