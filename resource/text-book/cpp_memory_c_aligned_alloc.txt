   aligned_alloc
   (C++17)
   free

   Defined in header <cstdlib>
   void* aligned_alloc( std::size_t alignment, std::size_t size );
                                                                  (since C++17)

   Allocate size bytes of uninitialized storage whose alignment is
   specified by alignment (implicitly creating objects in the destination
   area). The size parameter must be an integral multiple of alignment.

   The following functions are required to be thread-safe:
     * The library versions of operator new and operator delete
     * User replacement versions of global operator new and operator
       delete
     * std::calloc, std::malloc, std::realloc, std::aligned_alloc,
       std::free

   Calls to these functions that allocate or deallocate a particular unit
   of storage occur in a single total order, and each such deallocation
   call happens-before the next allocation (if any) in this order.

Parameters

   alignment - specifies the alignment. Must be a valid alignment
   supported by the implementation.
   size - number of bytes to allocate. An integral multiple of alignment.

Return value

   On success, returns the pointer to the beginning of newly allocated
   memory. To avoid a memory leak, the returned pointer must be
   deallocated with std::free or std::realloc.

   On failure, returns a null pointer.

Notes

   Passing a size which is not an integral multiple of alignment or an
   alignment which is not valid or not supported by the implementation
   causes the function to fail and return a null pointer (C11, as
   published, specified undefined behavior in this case, this was
   corrected by DR460).

   As an example of the "supported by the implementation" requirement,
   POSIX function posix_memalign accepts any alignment that is a power of
   two and a multiple of sizeof(void*), and POSIX-based implementations of
   aligned_alloc inherit this requirements.

   Fundamental alignments are always supported. If alignment is a power of
   two and not greater than alignof(std::max_align_t), aligned_alloc may
   simply call std::malloc.

   Regular std::malloc aligns memory suitable for any object type with a
   fundamental alignment. This function is useful for over-aligned
   allocations, such as to SSE, cache line, or VM page boundary.

   This function is not supported in Microsoft C Runtime library because
   its implementation of std::free is unable to handle aligned allocations
   of any kind. Instead, MS CRT provides _aligned_malloc (to be freed with
   _aligned_free).

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

int main()
{
    int* p1 = static_cast<int*>(std::malloc(10 * sizeof *p1));
    std::printf("default-aligned address:   %p\n", static_cast<void*>(p1));
    std::free(p1);

    int* p2 = static_cast<int*>(std::aligned_alloc(1024, 1024));
    std::printf("1024-byte aligned address: %p\n", static_cast<void*>(p2));
    std::free(p2);
}

   Possible output:
default-aligned address:   0x2221c20
1024-byte aligned address: 0x2222400
