   1) Default constructor. Constructs an empty shared_future object that
   does not refer to a shared state.
   2) Constructs a shared_future object, transferring the shared state
   held by f, if any. After construction, f.valid() is false.
   3) Constructs a shared future that refers to the same shared state as
   f, if any.
   4) Unwrapping constructor. Constructs a shared_future object from the
   shared state referred to by other, if any. If other.valid() == false
   prior to this call, the constructed shared_future object is empty.
   Otherwise, the resulting shared_future object becomes ready when one of
   the following happens:
     * other and other.get() are both ready. The value or exception from
       other.get() is stored in the shared state associated with the
       resulting shared_future object.
     * other is ready, but other.get() is invalid. An exception of type
       std::future_error with an error condition of
       std::future_errc::broken_promise is stored in the shared state
       associated with the resulting shared_future object.

   After this constructor returns, valid() is equal to the value of
   other.valid() prior to this call, and other.valid() == false.
   5) Constructs a shared_future object, transferring the shared state
   held by f, if any. After construction, f.valid() is false.

Parameters

   f     - another future object to initialize with
   other - a std::experimental::future object to unwrap
