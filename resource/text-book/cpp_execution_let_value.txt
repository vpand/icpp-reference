   Eager execution

   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto let_value(

       execution::sender auto input,
       std::invocable<values-sent-by(input)...> function
   );
                                    (since C++26)

Parameters

   input - sender which once executed sends the values upon which the
   function executes
   function - invocable to be called with the values from the input sender

Return value

   Returns a sender describing the task graph described by the input
   sender, with an added node of invoking the provided function with the
   values sent by the input sender as arguments.

   let_value is similar to then, however, where the sender returned from
   then sends exactly what that function ends up returning - let_value
   requires that the function returns a sender, and the sender returned by
   let_value sends the values sent by the sender returned from the
   callback.
