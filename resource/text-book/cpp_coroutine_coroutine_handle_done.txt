   Checks if a suspended coroutine is suspended at its final suspended
   point.
   1) Returns true if the coroutine to which *this refers is suspended at
   its final suspend point, or false if the coroutine is suspended at
   other suspend points. The behavior is undefined if *this does not refer
   to a suspended coroutine.
   2) Always returns false.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   1) true if the coroutine is suspended at its final suspend point, false
   if the coroutine is suspended at other suspend points.
   2) false

Notes

   A no-op coroutine is always considered not suspended at its final
   suspended point.
