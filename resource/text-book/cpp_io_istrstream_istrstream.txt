   Constructs new std::istrstream and its underlying std::strstreambuf.
   1,2) Constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf by calling
   strstreambuf(s, 0) and initializes the base class with the address of
   the strstreambuf. The behavior is undefined if s is not pointing at an
   element of a null-terminated array.
   3,4) Constructs the underlying std::strstreambuf by calling
   strstreambuf(s, n) and initializes the base class with the address of
   the strstreambuf. The behavior is undefined if s is not pointing at an
   element of an array whose length is at least n elements.

Parameters

   s - C-string or char array to use as the contents of the stream
   n - size of the array

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    std::istrstream s1("1 2 3"); // string literal
    int n1, n2, n3;
    if (s1 >> n1 >> n2 >> n3)
        std::cout << n1 << ", " << n2 << ", " << n3 << '\n';

    char arr[] = {'4', ' ', '5', ' ', '6'};
    std::istrstream s2(arr, sizeof arr);
    if (s2 >> n1 >> n2 >> n3)
        std::cout << n1 << ", " << n2 << ", " << n3 << '\n';
}

   Output:
1, 2, 3
4, 5, 6
