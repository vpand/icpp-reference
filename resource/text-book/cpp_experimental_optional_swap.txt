   void swap( optional& other ) noexcept(/* see below */);
   (library fundamentals TS)

   Swaps the contents with those of other.
     * If neither *this nor other contain a value, the function has no
       effect.

     * If only one of *this and other contains a value (let's call this
       object in and the other un), the contained value of un is
       direct-initialized from std::move(*in), followed by destruction of
       the contained value of in as if by in.val->T::~T(). After this
       call, in does not contain a value un contains a value.

     * If both *this and other contain values, the contained values are
       exchanged by calling using std::swap; swap(**this, *other). T
       lvalues must satisfy Swappable.

Parameters

   other - the optional object to exchange the contents with

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(std::is_nothrow_move_constructible<T>::value &&
              noexcept(swap(std::declval<T&>(), std::declval<T&>())))

   In the case of thrown exception, the states of the contained values of
   *this and other are determined by the exception safety guarantees of
   swap of type T or T's move constructor, whichever is called. For both
   *this and other, if the object contained a value, it is left containing
   a value, and the other way round.
