   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class From, class To >

   concept bool ConvertibleTo =
       std::is_convertible<From, To>::value &&
       requires(From (&f)()) {
           static_cast<To>(f());
       };
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept ConvertibleTo<From, To> specifies that an expression of the
   type and value category specified by From can be implicitly and
   explicitly converted to the type To, and the two forms of conversion
   are equivalent.

   Specifically, ConvertibleTo<From, To> is satisfied only if, given the
   invented function To test(From (&f)()) { return f(); } and a function f
   of type From () such that the expression f() is equality-preserving
   (see below),
     * Either
          + To is neither an object type nor a reference-to-object type,
            or
          + static_cast<To>(f()) is equal to test(f), and

     * One of the following is true:
          + From is not a reference-to-object type, or
          + From is an rvalue reference to a non-const-qualified type, and
            the resulting state of the object referenced by f() is valid
            but unspecified after either expression above; or
          + the object referred to by f() is not modified by either
            expression above.

   There need not be any subsumption relationship between
   ConvertibleTo<From, To> and std::is_convertible<From, To>::value.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.
