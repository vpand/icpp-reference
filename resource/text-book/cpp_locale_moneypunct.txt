   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class CharT, bool International = false >
   class moneypunct;

   The facet std::moneypunct encapsulates monetary value format
   preferences. Stream I/O manipulators std::get_money and std::put_money
   use std::moneypunct through std::money_get and std::money_put for
   parsing monetary value input and formatting monetary value output.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale
   object):
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::moneypunct<char> provides equivalents of the "C" locale
   preferences
   std::moneypunct<wchar_t> provides wide character equivalents of the "C"
   locale preferences
   std::moneypunct<char, true> provides equivalents of the "C" locale
   preferences, with international currency symbols
   std::moneypunct<wchar_t, true> provides wide character equivalents of
   the "C" locale preferences, with international currency symbols
