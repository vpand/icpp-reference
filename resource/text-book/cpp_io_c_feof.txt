   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int feof( std::FILE* stream );

   Checks if the end of the given file stream has been reached.

Parameters

   stream - the file stream to check

Return value

   Nonzero value if the end of the stream has been reached, otherwise 0.

Notes

   This function only reports the stream state as reported by the most
   recent I/O operation, it does not examine the associated data source.
   For example, if the most recent I/O was a std::fgetc, which returned
   the last byte of a file, std::feof returns zero. The next std::fgetc
   fails and changes the stream state to end-of-file. Only then std::feof
   returns non-zero.

   In typical usage, input stream processing stops on any error; feof and
   std::ferror are then used to distinguish between different error
   conditions.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>

int main()
{
    int is_ok = EXIT_FAILURE;
    FILE* fp = std::fopen("/tmp/test.txt", "w+");
    if (!fp)
    {
        std::perror("File opening failed");
        return is_ok;
    }

    int c; // Note: int, not char, required to handle EOF
    while ((c = std::fgetc(fp)) != EOF) // Standard C I/O file reading loop
        std::putchar(c);

    if (std::ferror(fp))
        std::puts("I/O error when reading");
    else if (std::feof(fp))
    {
        std::puts("End of file reached successfully");
        is_ok = EXIT_SUCCESS;
    }

    std::fclose(fp);
    return is_ok;
}

   Output:
End of file reached successfully
