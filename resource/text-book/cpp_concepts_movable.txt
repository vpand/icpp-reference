   Defined in header <concepts>
   template< class T >

   concept movable =
       std::is_object_v<T> &&
       std::move_constructible<T> &&
       std::assignable_from<T&, T> &&
       std::swappable<T>;
                               (since C++20)

   The concept movable<T> specifies that T is an object type that can be
   moved (that is, it can be move constructed, move assigned, and lvalues
   of type T can be swapped).
