   Loads the data from the given locations, converts them to character
   string equivalents and writes the results to a variety of
   sinks/streams:
   1) Writes the results to the output stream stdout.
   2) Writes the results to the output stream stream.
   3) Writes the results to a character string buffer. The behavior is
   undefined if the string to be written (plus the terminating null
   character) exceeds the size of the array pointed to by buffer.
   4) Writes the results to a character string buffer. At most bufsz - 1
   characters are written. The resulting character string will be
   terminated with a null character, unless bufsz is zero. If bufsz is
   zero, nothing is written and buffer may be a null pointer, however the
   return value (number of bytes that would be written not including the
   null terminator) is still calculated and returned.
   5-8) Same as (1-4), except that the following errors are detected at
   runtime and call the currently installed constraint handler function:

          + the conversion specifier %n is present in format
          + any of the arguments corresponding to %s is a null pointer
          + stream or format or buffer is a null pointer
          + bufsz is zero or greater than RSIZE_MAX
          + encoding errors occur in any of string and character
            conversion specifiers
          + (for sprintf_s only), the string to be stored in buffer
            (including the trailing null) would exceed bufsz.

          As with all bounds-checked functions, printf_s , fprintf_s,
          sprintf_s, and snprintf_s are only guaranteed to be available if
          __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by the implementation and if the
          user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1
          before including <stdio.h>.

Parameters

   stream - output file stream to write to
   buffer - pointer to a character string to write to
   bufsz - up to bufsz - 1 characters may be written, plus the null
   terminator
   format - pointer to a null-terminated byte string specifying how to
   interpret the data
   ... - arguments specifying data to print. If any argument after default
   argument promotions is not the type expected by the corresponding
   conversion specifier, or if there are fewer arguments than required by
   format, the behavior is undefined. If there are more arguments than
   required by format, the extraneous arguments are evaluated and ignored.

   The format string consists of ordinary byte characters (except %),
   which are copied unchanged into the output stream, and conversion
   specifications. Each conversion specification has the following format:

          + introductory % character.

          + (optional) one or more flags that modify the behavior of the
            conversion:

               o -: the result of the conversion is left-justified within
                 the field (by default it is right-justified).
               o +: the sign of signed conversions is always prepended to
                 the result of the conversion (by default the result is
                 preceded by minus only when it is negative).
               o space: if the result of a signed conversion does not
                 start with a sign character, or is empty, space is
                 prepended to the result. It is ignored if + flag is
                 present.
               o #: alternative form of the conversion is performed. See
                 the table below for exact effects otherwise the behavior
                 is undefined.
               o 0: for integer and floating-point number conversions,
                 leading zeros are used to pad the field instead of space
                 characters. For integer numbers it is ignored if the
                 precision is explicitly specified. For other conversions
                 using this flag results in undefined behavior. It is
                 ignored if - flag is present.

          + (optional) integer value or * that specifies minimum field
            width. The result is padded with space characters (by
            default), if required, on the left when right-justified, or on
            the right if left-justified. In the case when * is used, the
            width is specified by an additional argument of type int,
            which appears before the argument to be converted and the
            argument supplying precision if one is supplied. If the value
            of the argument is negative, it results with the - flag
            specified and positive field width (Note: This is the minimum
            width: The value is never truncated.).

          + (optional) . followed by integer number or *, or neither that
            specifies precision of the conversion. In the case when * is
            used, the precision is specified by an additional argument of
            type int, which appears before the argument to be converted,
            but after the argument supplying minimum field width if one is
            supplied. If the value of this argument is negative, it is
            ignored. If neither a number nor * is used, the precision is
            taken as zero. See the table below for exact effects of
            precision.

          + (optional) length modifier that specifies the size of the
            argument (in combination with the conversion format specifier,
            it specifies the type of the corresponding argument).

          + conversion format specifier.

   written. If Precision is not specified, writes every byte up to and not
   including the first null terminator. If the l specifier is used, the
   argument must be a pointer to the initial element of an array of
   wchar_t, which is converted to char array as if by a call to wcrtomb

   For the e conversion style [-]d.ddde±dd is used.
   For the E conversion style [-]d.dddE±dd is used.
   The exponent contains at least two digits, more digits are used only if
   necessary. If the value is 0, the exponent is also 0. Precision
   specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the decimal point
   character. The default precision is 6. In the alternative

   For the A conversion style [-]0Xh.hhhP±d is used.
   The first hexadecimal digit is not 0 if the argument is a normalized
   floating-point value. If the value is 0, the exponent is also 0.
   Precision specifies the exact number of digits to appear after the
   hexadecimal point character. The default precision is sufficient for
   exact representation of the value. In the alternative implementation
   decimal point character is written even if no digits follow it. For
   infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.

          Converts floating-point number to decimal or decimal exponent
          notation depending on the value and the precision.

   For the g conversion style conversion with style e or f will be
   performed.
   For the G conversion style conversion with style E or F will be
   performed.
   Let P equal the precision if nonzero, 6 if the precision is not
   specified, or 1 if the precision is 0. Then, if a conversion with style
   E would have an exponent of X:
     * if P > X >= -4, the conversion is with style f or F and precision P
       - 1 - X.
     * otherwise, the conversion is with style e or E and precision P - 1.

   Unless alternative representation is requested the trailing zeros are
   removed, also the decimal point character is removed if no fractional
   part is left. For infinity and not-a-number conversion style see notes.
   N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A
   n

          Returns the number of characters written so far by this call to

   The floating-point conversion functions convert infinity to inf or
   infinity. Which one is used is implementation defined.

   Not-a-number is converted to nan or nan(char_sequence). Which one is
   used is implementation defined.

   The conversions F, E, G, A output INF, INFINITY, NAN instead.

   Even though %c expects int argument, it is safe to pass a char because
   of the integer promotion that takes place when a variadic function is
   called.

   The correct conversion specifications for the fixed-width character
   types (int8_t, etc) are defined in the header <inttypes.h> (although
   PRIdMAX, PRIuMAX, etc is synonymous with %jd, %ju, etc).

   The memory-writing conversion specifier %n is a common target of
   security exploits where format strings depend on user input and is not
   supported by the bounds-checked printf_s family of functions.

   There is a sequence point after the action of each conversion
   specifier; this permits storing multiple %n results in the same
   variable or, as an edge case, printing a string modified by an earlier
   %n within the same call.

   If a conversion specification is invalid, the behavior is undefined.

Return value

   1,2) number of characters transmitted to the output stream or negative
   value if an output error or an encoding error (for string and character
   conversion specifiers) occurred.
   3) number of characters written to buffer (not counting the terminating
   null character), or a negative value if an encoding error (for string
   and character conversion specifiers) occurred.
   4) number of characters (not including the terminating null character)
   which would have been written to buffer if bufsz was ignored, or a
   negative value if an encoding error (for string and character
   conversion specifiers) occurred.
   5,6) number of characters transmitted to the output stream or negative
   value if an output error, a runtime constraints violation error, or an
   encoding error occurred.
   7) number of characters written to buffer, not counting the null
   character (which is always written as long as buffer is not a null
   pointer and bufsz is not zero and not greater than RSIZE_MAX), or zero
   on runtime constraint violations, and negative value on encoding
   errors.
   8) number of characters not including the terminating null character
   (which is always written as long as buffer is not a null pointer and
   bufsz is not zero and not greater than RSIZE_MAX), which would have
   been written to buffer if bufsz was ignored, or a negative value if a
   runtime constraints violation or an encoding error occurred.

Notes

   The C standard and POSIX specify that the behavior of sprintf and its
   variants is undefined when an argument overlaps with the destination
   buffer. Example:
sprintf(dst, "%s and %s", dst, t); // <- broken: undefined behavior

   POSIX specifies that errno is set on error. It also specifies
   additional conversion specifications, most notably support for argument
   reordering (n$ immediately after % indicates n^th argument).

   Calling snprintf with zero bufsz and null pointer for buffer is useful
   to determine the necessary buffer size to contain the output:
const char fmt[] = "sqrt(2) = %f";
int sz = snprintf(NULL, 0, fmt, sqrt(2));
char buf[sz + 1]; // note +1 for terminating null byte
snprintf(buf, sizeof buf, fmt, sqrt(2));

   snprintf_s, just like snprintf, but unlike sprintf_s, will truncate the
   output to fit in bufsz - 1.

Example

   Run this code
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    const char* s = "Hello";
    printf("Strings:\n"); // same as puts("Strings");
    printf(" padding:\n");
    printf("\t[%10s]\n", s);
    printf("\t[%-10s]\n", s);
    printf("\t[%*s]\n", 10, s);
    printf(" truncating:\n");
    printf("\t%.4s\n", s);
    printf("\t%.*s\n", 3, s);

    printf("Characters:\t%c %%\n", 'A');

    printf("Integers:\n");
    printf("\tDecimal:\t%i %d %.6i %i %.0i %+i %i\n",
                         1, 2,   3, 0,   0,  4,-4);
    printf("\tHexadecimal:\t%x %x %X %#x\n", 5, 10, 10, 6);
    printf("\tOctal:\t\t%o %#o %#o\n", 10, 10, 4);

    printf("Floating-point:\n");
    printf("\tRounding:\t%f %.0f %.32f\n", 1.5, 1.5, 1.3);
    printf("\tPadding:\t%05.2f %.2f %5.2f\n", 1.5, 1.5, 1.5);
    printf("\tScientific:\t%E %e\n", 1.5, 1.5);
    printf("\tHexadecimal:\t%a %A\n", 1.5, 1.5);
    printf("\tSpecial values:\t0/0=%g 1/0=%g\n", 0.0 / 0.0, 1.0 / 0.0);

    printf("Fixed-width types:\n");
    printf("\tLargest 32-bit value is %" PRIu32 " or %#" PRIx32 "\n",
                                     UINT32_MAX,     UINT32_MAX );
