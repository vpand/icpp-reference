   Defined in header <locale>
   template< class Facet >
   const Facet& use_facet( const std::locale& loc );

   Obtains a reference to a facet implemented by loc.

   The program is ill-formed if Facet is not a facet whose definition
   contains the public static member id or it is a volatile-qualified
   facet.

Parameters

   loc - the locale object to query

Return value

   Returns a reference to the facet. The reference returned by this
   function is valid as long as any std::locale object refers to that
   facet.

Exceptions

   std::bad_cast if std::has_facet<Facet>(loc) == false.

Notes

   A std::locale object should not be a temporary if a reference to the
   Facet object obtained from use_facet is used after the end of
   statement:
// BAD:
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char, true>>(std::locale{"no_NO.UTF-8"}
);
foo(f.curr_symbol()); // Error: f internally uses a dangling reference
                      // to a std::locale object that no longer exists.
// GOOD:
auto loc = std::locale{"is_IS.UTF-8"}; // OK: a non-temporary object
auto& f = std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char, true>>(loc);
foo(f.curr_symbol()); // OK: f internally uses a reference to existing locale ob
ject.

Example

   Display the 3-letter currency name used by the user's preferred locale.
   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

int main()
{
    for (const char* name: {"en_US.UTF-8", "de_DE.UTF-8", "en_GB.UTF-8"})
        std::cout << "Your currency string is "
                  << std::use_facet<std::moneypunct<char, true>>(std::locale{nam
e}).
                     curr_symbol() << '\n';
}

   Output:
Your currency string is USD
Your currency string is EUR
Your currency string is GBP

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 31 C++98 the returned reference remained usable
   as long as the locale value itself exists the returned reference
   remains usable as
   long as some locale object refers to that facet
   LWG 38 C++98 Facet was not required to have a direct member id required
   LWG 436 C++98 it was unclear whether Facet can be cv-qualified it can
   be const-qualified, but not volatile-qualified
