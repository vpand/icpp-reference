   Defined in header <wchar.h>
   wint_t ungetwc( wint_t ch, FILE *stream );
                                             (since C95)

   If ch does not equal WEOF, pushes the wide character ch into the input
   buffer associated with the stream stream in such a manner that
   subsequent read operation from stream will retrieve that wide
   character. The external device associated with the stream is not
   modified.

   Stream repositioning operations fseek, fsetpos, and rewind discard the
   effects of ungetwc.

   If ungetwc is called more than once without an intervening read or
   repositioning, it may fail (in other words, a pushback buffer of size 1
   is guaranteed, but any larger buffer is implementation-defined). If
   multiple successful ungetwc were performed, read operations retrieve
   the pushed-back wide characters in reverse order of ungetwc

   If ch equals WEOF, the operation fails and the stream is not affected.

   A successful call to ungetwc clears the end of file status flag feof.

   A successful call to ungetwc on a stream (whether text or binary)
   modifies the stream position indicator in unspecified manner but
   guarantees that after all pushed-back wide characters are retrieved
   with a read operation, the stream position indicator is equal to its
   value before ungetwc.

Parameters

   ch     - wide character to be put back
   stream - file stream to put the wide character back to

Return value

   On success ch is returned.

   On failure WEOF is returned and the given stream remains unchanged.
