   Deduction guides

   Defined in header <experimental/scope>
   template< class EF >
   scope_success(EF) -> scope_success<EF>;
                                         (library fundamentals TS v3)

   One deduction guide is provided for std::experimental::scope_success to
   permit deduction from an argument of function or function object type.

   The argument (after function-to-pointer decay, if any) is copied or
   moved into the constructed scope_success.
