   protected:
   virtual int_type pbackfail( int_type c = EOF );
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   This protected virtual function is called by the public functions
   basic_streambuf::sungetc and basic_streambuf::sputbackc (which, in
   turn, are called by basic_istream::unget and basic_istream::putback).
   1) The caller is requesting that the get area is backed up by one
   character (pbackfail() is called with no arguments or with EOF as the
   argument)
   a) First, checks if there is a putback position, and if there really
   isn't, fails (strstreambuf has no external character source to
   re-read).
   b) If the caller was wrong and the putback position is in fact
   available, simply decrements basic_streambuf::gptr(), e.g. by calling
   gbump(-1).
   2) The caller attempts to putback a different character from the one
   retrieved earlier (pbackfail() is called with the character that needs
   to be put back), in which case
   a) First, checks if there is a putback position, and if there isn't,
   fails.
   b) Then checks what character is in the putback position. If the
   character held there is already equal to (char)c, then simply
   decrements basic_streambuf::gptr().
   c) Otherwise, if the buffer is unmodifiable (this strstreambuf was
   constructed with a string literal or some other const array), fails.
   d) Otherwise, decrements basic_streambuf::gptr() and writes c to the
   location pointed to gptr() after adjustment.

Parameters

   c - the character to put back, or Traits::eof() to indicate that
   backing up of the get area is requested

Return value

   c on success except if c was EOF, in which case unspecified value other
   than EOF is returned.

   EOF on failure.
