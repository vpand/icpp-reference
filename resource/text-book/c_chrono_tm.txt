   Defined in header <time.h>
   struct tm;

   Structure holding a calendar date and time broken down into its
   components.

Member objects

   int tm_sec
   seconds after the minute - [0, 61](until C99)[0, 60](since C99)^[note
   1]
   (public member object)
   int tm_min
   minutes after the hour - [0, 59]
   (public member object)
   int tm_hour
   hours since midnight - [0, 23]
   (public member object)
   int tm_mday
   day of the month - [1, 31]
   (public member object)
   int tm_mon
   months since January - [0, 11]
   (public member object)
   int tm_year
   years since 1900
   (public member object)
   int tm_wday
   days since Sunday - [0, 6]
   (public member object)
   int tm_yday
   days since January 1 - [0, 365]
   (public member object)
   int tm_isdst
   Daylight Saving Time flag. The value is positive if DST is in effect,
   zero if not and negative if no information is available
   (public member object)

Notes

   The Standard mandates only the presence of the aforementioned members
   in either order. The implementations usually add more data-members to
   this structure.
    1. ^| Range allows for a positive leap second. Two leap seconds in the
       same minute are not allowed (the C89 range 0..61 was a defect)

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void)
{
    struct tm start = {.tm_year=2022-1900, .tm_mday=1};
    mktime(&start);
    printf("%s", asctime(&start));
}

   Output:
Sat Jan  1 00:00:00 2022
