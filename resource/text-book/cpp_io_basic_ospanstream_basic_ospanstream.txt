   explicit basic_ospanstream( std::span<CharT> s, std::ios_base::openmode
   mode =
                                   std::ios_base::out );
   (1) (since C++23)
   basic_ospanstream( basic_ospanstream&& rhs );
   (2) (since C++23)
   basic_ospanstream( const basic_ospanstream& ) = delete;
   (3) (since C++23)

   Constructs a new basic_ospanstream.
   1) Uses the storage referenced by s as initial underlying buffer of the
   wrapped std::basic_spanbuf device. The wrapped std::basic_spanbuf
   object is constructed as basic_spanbuf<Char, Traits>(s, mode |
   std::ios_base::out).
   2) Move constructor. Move constructs the std::basic_ostream base
   subobject and the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf from those of rhs, and
   then calls set_rdbuf with the address of the wrapped std::basic_spanbuf
   in *this to install it.
   3) Copy constructor is deleted. basic_ospanstream is not copyable.

Parameters

   s - std::span referencing the storage to be use as initial underlying
   buffer of stream
   mode - specifies stream open mode. Following constants and bit-wise OR
   between them may be used:
   Constant          Explanation
   app               seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary            open in binary mode
   in                open for reading
   out               open for writing
   trunc             discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate               seek to the end of stream immediately after open
   noreplace (C++23) open in exclusive mode
   other - another basic_ospanstream to be moved from

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
