 explicit basic_istream( std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>* sb );
 (1)
   protected:
   basic_istream( const basic_istream& rhs ) = delete;
 (2)                                                               (since C++11)
   protected:
   basic_istream( basic_istream&& rhs );
 (3)                                                               (since C++11)

   1) Constructs the basic_istream object, assigning initial values to the
   base class by calling basic_ios::init(sb). The value of gcount() is
   initialized to zero.

   2) The copy constructor is protected, and is deleted. Input streams are
   not copyable.

   3) The move constructor copies the value of gcount() from rhs, sets the
   gcount() value of rhs to zero, and uses basic_ios<CharT,
   Traits>::move(rhs) to move all basic_ios members, except for the
   rdbuf(), from rhs into *this. This move constructor is protected: it is
   called by the move constructors of movable input stream classes
   std::basic_ifstream and std::basic_istringstream, which know how to
   correctly move the associated stream buffer.

Parameters

   sb - streambuffer to use as underlying device

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::istringstream s1("hello");
    std::istream s2(s1.rdbuf()); // OK: s2 shares the buffer with s1

//  std::istream s3(std::istringstream("test")); // ERROR: move constructor is p
rotected
//  std::istream s4(s2);                         // ERROR: copy constructor is d
eleted
    std::istringstream s5(std::istringstream("world")); // OK: move ctor called
                                                        //     by derived class

    std::cout << s2.rdbuf() << ' ' << s5.rdbuf() << '\n';
}

   Output:
hello world
