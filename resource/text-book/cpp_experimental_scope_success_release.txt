   void release() noexcept;
                           (library fundamentals TS v3)

   Makes the scope_success inactive.

   Once a scope_success is inactive, it cannot become active again, and
   will not call its exit function on destruction.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)

Notes

   release may be either manually called or automatically called by
   scope_success's move constructor.
