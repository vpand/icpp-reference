   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >
   concept bool Semiregular = Copyable<T> && DefaultConstructible<T>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The Semiregular concept specifies that a type is both copyable and
   default constructible. It is satisfied by types that behave similarly
   to built-in types like int, except that they need not support
   comparison with ==.
