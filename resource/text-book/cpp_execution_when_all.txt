   Eager execution

   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto when_all(

       execution::sender auto ...inputs
   );
                                   (since C++26)

Parameters

   inputs - senders upon which the completion of when_all is blocked. Can
   only include senders that can complete with a single set of values.

Return value

   Returns a sender that completes once all of the input senders have
   completed. The values sent by this sender are the values sent by each
   of the input senders, in order of the arguments passed to when_all.

Notes

     * The sender returned by when_all completes inline on the execution
       resource on which the last input sender completes, unless stop is
       requested before when_all is started, in which case it completes
       inline within the call to start.
