   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class F, class... Args >

   concept bool Predicate =
       RegularInvocable<F, Args...> &&
       Boolean<std::result_of_t<F&&(Args&&...)>>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept Predicate<F, Args...> specifies that F is a predicate that
   accepts arguments whose types and value categories are encoded by
   Args..., i.e., it can be invoked with these arguments to produce a
   Boolean result.

   Note that RegularInvocable requires the invocation to not modify either
   the callable object or the arguments and be equality-preserving.

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.
