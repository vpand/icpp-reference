   Defined in header <fstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
   > class basic_filebuf : public std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>

   std::basic_filebuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character
   sequence is a file. Both the input sequence and the output sequence are
   associated with the same file, and a joint file position is maintained
   for both operations. The restrictions on reading and writing a sequence
   with std::basic_filebuf are the same as std::FILEs.

   The functions underflow() and overflow() / sync() perform the actual
   I/O between the file and the get and put areas of the buffer. When
   CharT is not char, most implementations store multibyte characters in
   the file and a std::codecvt facet is used to perform wide/multibyte
   character conversion.

   Several typedefs for common character types are provided:
   Defined in header <streambuf>
   Type          Definition
   std::filebuf  std::basic_filebuf<char>
   std::wfilebuf std::basic_filebuf<wchar_t>

Member types

   std::fpos<Traits::state_type>
   off_type Traits::off_type

   TriviallyCopyable and semiregular
