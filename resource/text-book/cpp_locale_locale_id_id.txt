   Defined in header <locale>
   id();
   (1)
   id( const id& ) = delete;
   (2)
   1) Default constructor: creates an object of type std::locale::id with
   implementation-specific content.
   2) Copy constructor is deleted; std::locale::id is not copyable.

Notes

   Because locales and facets must be available for the IO stream objects
   with static storage duration, such as std::cout, typical
   implementations let implicit default constructor zero-initialize the
   contents of std::locale::id during static initialization (before
   constructors run for static objects), and when a facet is added to any
   locale for the first time, the locale completes initialization of the
   facet's id.
