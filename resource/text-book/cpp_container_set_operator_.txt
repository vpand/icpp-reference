   Replaces the contents of the container.
   1) Copy assignment operator. Replaces the contents with a copy of the
   contents of other.

   If
   std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_copy_assi
   gnment::value is true, the allocator of *this is replaced by a copy of
   other. If the allocator of *this after assignment would compare unequal
   to its old value, the old allocator is used to deallocate the memory,
   then the new allocator is used to allocate it before copying the
   elements. Otherwise, the memory owned by *this may be reused when
   possible. In any case, the elements originally belonging to *this may
   be either destroyed or replaced by element-wise copy-assignment.
   (since C++11)
   2) Move assignment operator. Replaces the contents with those of other
   using move semantics (i.e. the data in other is moved from other into
   this container). other is in a valid but unspecified state afterwards.
   If
   std::allocator_traits<allocator_type>::propagate_on_container_move_assi
   gnment::value is true, the allocator of *this is replaced by a copy of
   that of other. If it is false and the allocators of *this and other do
   not compare equal, *this cannot take ownership of the memory owned by
   other and must move-assign each element individually, allocating
   additional memory using its own allocator as needed. In any case, all
   elements originally belonging to *this are either destroyed or replaced
   by element-wise move-assignment.
   3) Replaces the contents with those identified by initializer list
   ilist.

Parameters

   other - another container to use as data source
   ilist - initializer list to use as data source

Return value

   *this

Complexity

   1) Linear in the size of *this and other.
   2) Linear in the size of *this unless the allocators do not compare
   equal and do not propagate, in which case linear in the size of *this
   and other.
   3) O(NlogN) in general, where N is size() + ilist.size(). Linear if
   ilist is sorted with respect to value_comp().

Exceptions

   1-3) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
   (until C++17)
   1,3) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
   2)
   noexcept specification:
   noexcept(std::allocator_traits<Allocator>::is_always_equal::value
   && std::is_nothrow_move_assignable<Compare>::value)
   (since C++17)

Notes

   After container move assignment (overload (2)), unless element-wise
   move assignment is forced by incompatible allocators, references,
   pointers, and iterators (other than the end iterator) to other remain
   valid, but refer to elements that are now in *this. The current
   standard makes this guarantee via the blanket statement in
   [container.reqmts]/67, and a more direct guarantee is under
   consideration via LWG issue 2321.

Example

   The following code uses operator= to assign one std::set to another:
   Run this code
#include <initializer_list>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <set>

void print(auto const comment, auto const& container)
{
    auto size = std::size(container);
    std::cout << comment << "{ ";
    for (auto const& element : container)
        std::cout << element << (--size ? ", " : " ");
    std::cout << "}\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::set<int> x{1, 2, 3}, y, z;
    const auto w = {4, 5, 6, 7};

    std::cout << "Initially:\n";
    print("x = ", x);
    print("y = ", y);
    print("z = ", z);

    std::cout << "Copy assignment copies data from x to y:\n";
    y = x;
    print("x = ", x);
    print("y = ", y);

    std::cout << "Move assignment moves data from x to z, modifying both x and z
:\n";
    z = std::move(x);
    print("x = ", x);
    print("z = ", z);

    std::cout << "Assignment of initializer_list w to z:\n";
    z = w;
    print("w = ", w);
    print("z = ", z);
}

   Output:
Initially:
x = { 1, 2, 3 }
y = { }
z = { }
Copy assignment copies data from x to y:
x = { 1, 2, 3 }
y = { 1, 2, 3 }
Move assignment moves data from x to z, modifying both x and z:
x = { }
z = { 1, 2, 3 }
Assignment of initializer_list w to z:
w = { 4, 5, 6, 7 }
z = { 4, 5, 6, 7 }
