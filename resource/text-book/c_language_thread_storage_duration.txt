   Technical Specifications

   An object whose identifier is declared with the storage-class specifier
   _Thread_local (since C11) has thread storage duration. Its lifetime is
   the entire execution of the thread for which it is created, and its
   stored value is initialized when the thread is started. There is a
   distinct object per thread, and use of the declared name in an
   expression refers to the object associated with the thread evaluating
   the expression. The result of attempting to indirectly access an object
   with thread storage duration from a thread other than the one with
   which the object is associated is implementation-defined.

Example

   Run this code
const double PI = 3.14159;         /* const variable is global to all threads  *
/
_Thread_local unsigned int seed;   /* seed is a thread-specific variable       *
/

int main(void)
{
    return 0;
}

   Possible output:
(none)
