   strerror

   Defined in header <cstring>
   char* strcat( char* dest, const char* src );

   Appends a copy of the character string pointed to by src to the end of
   the character string pointed to by dest. The character src[0] replaces
   the null terminator at the end of dest. The resulting byte string is
   null-terminated.

   The behavior is undefined if the destination array is not large enough
   for the contents of both src and dest and the terminating null
   character.

   The behavior is undefined if the strings overlap.

Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to append to
   src  - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to copy from

Return value

   dest

Notes

   Because strcat needs to seek to the end of dest on each call, it is
   inefficient to concatenate many strings into one using strcat.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>

int main()
{
    char str[50] = "Hello ";
    char str2[50] = "World!";
    std::strcat(str, str2);
    std::strcat(str, " Goodbye World!");
    std::puts(str);
}

   Output:
Hello World! Goodbye World!
