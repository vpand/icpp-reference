   The concept RandomAccessIterator<I> refines BidirectionalIterator by
   adding support for constant time advancement with the +=, +, -=, and -
   operators, constant time computation of distance with -, and array
   notation with subscripting.

   Let a and b be valid iterators of type I such that b is reachable from
   a, and let n be a value of type ranges::difference_type_t<I> equal to b
   - a. RandomAccessIterator<I> is satisfied only if:
     * (a += n) is equal to b.
     * std::addressof(a += n) is equal to std::addressof(a).
     * (a + n) is equal to (a += n).
     * (a + n) is equal to (n + a).
     * For any two positive integers x and y, if a + (x + y) is valid,
       then a + (x + y) is equal to (a + x) + y.
     * a + 0 is equal to a.
     * If (a + (n - 1)) is valid, then --b is equal to (a + (n - 1)).
     * (b += -n) and (b -= n) are both equal to a.
     * std::addressof(b -= n) is equal to std::addressof(b).
     * (b - n) is equal to (b -= n).
     * If b is dereferenceable, then a[n] is valid and is equal to *b.
     * bool(a <= b) is true .

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.

Implicit expression variations

   A requires-expression that uses an expression that is non-modifying for
   some constant lvalue operand also implicitly requires additional
   variations of that expression that accept a non-constant lvalue or
   (possibly constant) rvalue for the given operand unless such an
   expression variation is explicitly required with differing semantics.
   These implicit expression variations must meet the same semantic
   requirements of the declared expression. The extent to which an
   implementation validates the syntax of the variations is unspecified.
