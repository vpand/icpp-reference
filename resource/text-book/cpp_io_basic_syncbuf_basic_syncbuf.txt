   basic_syncbuf()
       : basic_syncbuf( nullptr )
   (1)
   explicit basic_syncbuf( streambuf_type* obuf )
       : basic_syncbuf( obuf, Allocator() ) {}
   (2)
   basic_syncbuf( streambuf_type* obuf, const Allocator& a );
   (3)
   basic_syncbuf( basic_syncbuf&& rhs );
   (4)
   1) Default constructor: creates an instance of std::basic_syncbuf with
   emit-on-sync policy set to false, wrapped streambuffer set to nullptr,
   and using default-constructed Allocator as the allocator for temporary
   storage.
   2,3) Creates an instance of std::basic_syncbuf with emit-on-sync policy
   set to false, wrapped streambuffer set to obuf, and using a as the
   allocator for temporary storage.
   4) Move constructor: move-constructs a std::basic_syncbuf object by
   moving all contents from another std::basic_syncbuf object rhs,
   including the temporary storage, the wrapped stream pointer, policy,
   and all other state (such as the mutex pointer). After move, rhs is not
   associated with a stream, and rhs.get_wrapped() == nullptr. The put
   area member pointers of the base class std::basic_streambuf of rhs are
   guaranteed to be null. Destroying a moved-from rhs will not produce any
   output.

Parameters

   obuf - pointer to the std::basic_streambuf to wrap
   a    - the allocator to use for temporary storage
   rhs  - another std::basic_syncbuf to move from

Exceptions

   2,3) May throw std::bad_alloc from the constructor of the internal
   temporary storage or std::system_error from the mutex construction.

Notes

   Typically called by the appropriate constructors of
   std::basic_osyncstream.
