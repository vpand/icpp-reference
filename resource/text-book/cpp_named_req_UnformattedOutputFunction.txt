Requirements

   A UnformattedOutputFunction is a stream output function that performs
   the following:
   1) Constructs an object of type basic_ostream::sentry with automatic
   storage duration, which performs the following:
     * If eofbit or badbit are set on the output stream, sets the failbit
       as well, and if exceptions on failbit are enabled in this output
       stream's exception mask ((exceptions() & failbit) != 0), throws
       ios_base::failure.
     * Flushes the tie()'d output stream, if applicable.

   2) Checks the status of the sentry by calling sentry::operator bool(),
   which is equivalent to basic_ios::good.
     * If the operator returns false or sentry's constructor throws an
       exception, no output takes place.
     * If the operator returns true, attempts to perform the desired
       output by inserting the characters into the output stream as if by
       calling rdbuf()->sputc(). Other public members of
       std::basic_ostream may also be used, but virtual members of rdbuf()
       except overflow(), xsputn() and sync() will never be called.

          + If an exception is thrown during output, sets badbit in the
            output stream. If exceptions on badbit are enabled in this
            stream's exception mask ((exceptions() & badbit) != 0), the
            exception is also rethrown.
          + If no exception was thrown, returns the value specified by the
            function.

   3) In any event, whether terminating by exception or returning, the
   sentry's destructor is called before leaving this function.

Standard library

   The following standard library functions are
   UnformattedOutputFunctions.
     * basic_ostream::operator<<(basic_streambuf*)
     * basic_ostream::put
     * basic_ostream::write
     * basic_ostream::flush

     * basic_ostream::tellp (except calls pubseekoff instead of output)
     * basic_ostream::seekp (except calls pubseekoff or pubseekpos instead
       of output)

   (since C++11)

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 63 C++98 the exception-handling policy was missing added
   LWG 160 C++98 the process of determining whether the exception caught
   is rethrown mentioned a non-existing function exception() corrected to
   exceptions()
   LWG 165 C++98 the only virtual member allowed to be
   called on rdbuf() was overflow() also allowed
   xsputn() and sync()
