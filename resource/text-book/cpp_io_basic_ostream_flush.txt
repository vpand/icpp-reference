   basic_ostream& flush();

   Writes uncommitted changes to the underlying output sequence. Behaves
   as an UnformattedOutputFunction.

   If rdbuf() is a null pointer, the sentry object is not constructed.

   Otherwise, after constructing and checking the sentry object, calls
   rdbuf()->pubsync(). If the call returns -1, calls setstate(badbit).

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   May throw std::ios_base::failure if (exceptions() & badbit) != 0.

Example

   Run this code
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <thread>

using namespace std::chrono_literals;

void f()
{
    std::cout << "Output from thread... ";
    for (int i{1}; i != 10; ++i)
    {
        std::this_thread::sleep_for(250ms);
        std::cout << i << ' ';

        // output three numbers at once;
        // the effect is observable only in real-time
        if (0 == (i % 3))
            std::cout.flush();
    }
    std::cout << std::endl; // flushes as well
}

int main()
{
    std::thread tr{f};
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(150ms);
    std::clog << "Output from main\n";
    tr.join();
}

   Output:
Output from main
Output from thread... 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 581 C++98 flush() did not behave as an UnformattedOutputFunction
   because of the resolution of LWG issue 60 behaves as an
   UnformattedOutputFunction
