   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T, class U >

   concept bool DerivedFrom =
       std::is_base_of<U, T>::value &&
       std::is_convertible<std::remove_cv_t<T>*,
   std::remove_cv_t<U>*>::value;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept DerivedFrom<T, U> is satisfied if and only if U is a class
   type that is either T or a public and unambiguous base of T.

   Despite the use of std::is_base_of and std::is_convertible in its
   description above, DerivedFrom is not required to use it in its
   implementation. Thus, there need not be any subsumption relationship
   between DerivedFrom<T, U> and std::is_base_of<U,T>::value or
   std::is_convertible<std::remove_cv_t<T>*, std::remove_cv_t<U>*>::value.
