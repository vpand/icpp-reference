   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/functional>
   template< class T = void >

       requires EqualityComparable<T> ||
                Same<T, void> ||
                /* == on two const T lvalues invokes a built-in operator
   comparing pointers */
   struct not_equal_to;

                                                     (ranges TS)

   Function object for performing comparisons. The primary template
   invokes operator == on const lvalues of type T and negates the result.
   The specialization not_equal_to<void> deduces the parameter types of
   the function call operator from the arguments (but not the return
   type).

   All specializations of not_equal_to are Semiregular.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   is_transparent (member only of not_equal_to<void> specialization) /*
   unspecified */

Member functions

   operator()
   checks if the arguments are not equal
   (public member function)

std::experimental::ranges::not_equal_to::operator()

   constexpr bool operator()(const T& x, const T& y) const;
   (1) (member only of primary not_equal_to<T> template)
   template< class T, class U >

       requires EqualityComparableWith<T, U> ||
                /* std::declval<T>() == std::declval<U>() resolves to
                   a built-in operator comparing pointers */
   constexpr bool operator()(T&& t, U&& u) const;
   (2) (member only of not_equal_to<void> specialization)
   1) Compares x and y. Equivalent to return !ranges::equal_to<>{}(x, y);.
   2) Compares t and u. Equivalent to return
   !ranges::equal_to<>{}(std::forward<T>(t), std::forward<U>(u));.

Notes

   Unlike std::not_equal_to, ranges::not_equal_to requires both == and !=
   to be valid (via the EqualityComparable and EqualityComparableWith
   constraints), and is entirely defined in terms of ranges::equal_to.
   However, the implementation is free to use operator!= directly, because
   those concepts require the results of == and != to be consistent.
