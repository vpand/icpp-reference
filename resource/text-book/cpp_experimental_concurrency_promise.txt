   This page is about the modified version of std::promise provided by the
   concurrency TS supporting the std::future improvements made by that TS.
   For the version of promise with type-erased allocator support provided
   by the Library Fundamentals TSes, see
   std::experimental::fundamentals_v2::promise.

   std::experimental::concurrency_v1::promise is a modified version of
   std::promise provided by the concurrency TS that works with
   std::experimental::future.

   The only change from std::promise is that the get_future() member
   function returns a std::experimental::future.
