   bool is_open() const;

   Returns true if the most recent call to open() succeeded and there has
   been no call to close() since then.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   true if the associated file is open, false otherwise.

Notes

   This function is typically called by std::basic_fstream::is_open().

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::ifstream fs("test.txt");
    std::filebuf fb;
    fb.open("test.txt", std::ios_base::in);
    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << "direct call: " << fb.is_open() << '\n'
              << "through streambuf: " << fs.rdbuf()->is_open() << '\n'
              << "through fstream: " << fs.is_open() << '\n';
}

   Output:
direct call: true
through streambuf: true
through fstream: true
