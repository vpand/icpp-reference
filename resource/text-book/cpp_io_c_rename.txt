   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int rename( const char* old_filename, const char* new_filename );

   Changes the filename of a file. The file is identified by character
   string pointed to by old_filename. The new filename is identified by
   character string pointed to by new_filename.

   If new_filename exists, the behavior is implementation-defined.

Parameters

   old_filename - pointer to a null-terminated string containing the path
   identifying the file to rename
   new_filename - pointer to a null-terminated string containing the new
   path of the file

Return value

   0 upon success or non-zero value on error.

Notes

   POSIX specifies many additional details on the semantics of this
   function, which are reproduced in C++ by std::filesystem::rename.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    if (!std::ofstream("from.txt").put('a')) // create and write to file
    {
        std::perror("Error creating from.txt");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    if (std::rename("from.txt", "to.txt"))
    {
        std::perror("Error renaming");
        return EXIT_FAILURE;
    }

    std::cout << std::ifstream("to.txt").rdbuf() << '\n'; // print file
    return EXIT_SUCCESS;
}

   Output:
a
