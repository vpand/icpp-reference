   Defined in header <locale>

       class CharT,
       class OutputIt = std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT>
   > class num_put;

   Class std::num_put encapsulates the rules for formatting numeric values
   as strings. Specifically, the types bool, long, unsigned long, long
   long, unsigned long long(since C++11), double, long double, void*, and
   of all types implicitly convertible to these (such as int or float) are
   supported. The standard formatting output operators (such as cout <<
   n;) use the std::num_put facet of the I/O stream's locale to generate
   text representation of numbers.

   Inheritance diagram

   If a std::num_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by
   the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and
   do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale
   object):
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::num_put<char>    creates narrow string representations of numbers
   std::num_put<wchar_t> creates wide string representations of numbers

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every
   specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:
     * CharT is one of
          + char,
          + wchar_t, and
          + any other implementation-defined character container type that
            meets the requirements for a character on which any of the
            iostream components can be instantiated; and
     * OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   char_type   CharT
   iter_type   OutputIt

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new num_put facet
   (public member function)
   put
   invokes do_put
   (public member function)

Protected member functions

   (destructor)
   destructs a num_put facet
   (protected member function)
   do_put
   [virtual]
   formats a number and writes to output stream
   (virtual protected member function)

Member objects

   static std::locale::id id
   id of the locale
   (public member object)

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    double n = 1234567.89;
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("de_DE.UTF-8"));
    std::cout << "Direct conversion to string:\n"
              << std::to_string(n) << '\n'
              << "Output using a german locale:\n"
              << std::fixed << n << '\n'
              << "Output using an american locale:\n";

    // use the facet directly
    std::cout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.UTF-8"));
    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::num_put<char>>(std::cout.getloc());
    f.put(std::ostreambuf_iterator<char>(std::cout), std::cout, ' ', n);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
Direct conversion to string:
1234567.890000
Output using a german locale:
1.234.567,890000
Output using an american locale:
1,234,567.890000

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 427 C++98 num_put was guaranteed to accept any CharT that
   meets the requirements for a character on which
   any of the iostream components can be instantiated only guarantees to
   accept char,
   wchar_t and other implementation-
   defined character types
   LWG 2392 C++98 only character type CharT could be
   guaranteed to be accepted by num_put can guarantee to accept
   implementation-
   defined character container types
