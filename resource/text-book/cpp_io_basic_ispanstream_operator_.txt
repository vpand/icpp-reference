 basic_ispanstream& operator=( basic_ispanstream&& other );
 (1)                                                               (since C++23)
 basic_ispanstream& operator=( const basic_ispanstream& ) = delete;
 (2)                                                               (since C++23)
   1) Move assigns the other to *this, effectively move-assigning both the
   std::basic_istream base class subobject and the wrapped
   std::basic_spanbuf.
   2) Copy assignment operator is deleted. basic_ispanstream is not copy
   assignable.

   Note that move assignment operator of the base class swaps all stream
   state variables (except for rdbuf()) between *this and other.

   It is implementation-defined whether the std::basic_spanbuf wrapped in
   other still holds an underlying buffer after the move assignment.

Parameters

   other - another stream to move from

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
