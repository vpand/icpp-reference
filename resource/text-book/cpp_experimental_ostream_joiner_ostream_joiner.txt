   ostream_joiner( ostream_type& stream, const DelimT& delimiter );
   (1) (library fundamentals TS v2)
   ostream_joiner( ostream_type& stream, DelimT&& delimiter );
   (2) (library fundamentals TS v2)
   ostream_joiner( const ostream_joiner& other ) = default;
   (3) (library fundamentals TS v2)
   (implicitly declared)
   ostream_joiner( ostream_joiner&& other ) = default;
   (4) (library fundamentals TS v2)
   (implicitly declared)
   1) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member
   initialized with std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member
   initialized with delimiter, and the private "first element" flag set to
   true.
   2) Constructs the iterator with the private ostream_type* member
   initialized with std::addressof(stream), the private delimiter member
   initialized with std::move(delimiter), and the private "first element"
   flag set to true.
   3,4) Implicitly declared copy/move constructor that copy/move
   constructs the private stream pointer, delimiter, and "first element"
   flag members.

Parameters

   stream - the output stream to be accessed by this iterator
   delimiter - the delimiter to be inserted into the stream in between two
   outputs
   other - the ostream_joiner object from which this object is to be copy-
   or move-constructed
