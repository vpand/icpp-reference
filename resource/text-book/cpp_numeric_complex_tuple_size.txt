   Helper types
   tuple_size<std::complex>
   (C++26)
   tuple_element<std::complex>
   (C++26)

   Defined in header <complex>
   template< class T >

   struct tuple_size<std::complex<T>>
       : std::integral_constant<std::size_t, 2> {};
                              (since C++26)

   The partial specialization of std::tuple_size for std::complex provides
   a compile-time way to obtain the number of components of a complex,
   which is always 2, using tuple-like syntax. It is provided for
   structured binding support.

Inherited from std::integral_constant

Member constants

   value
   [static]
   the constant value 2
   (public static member constant)

Member functions

   operator std::size_t
   converts the object to std::size_t, returns value
   (public member function)
   operator()
   (C++14)
   returns value
   (public member function)

Member types

   Type       Definition
   value_type std::size_t
   type       std::integral_constant<std::size_t, value>

Example

   Run this code
#include <complex>

static_assert(std::tuple_size_v<std::complex<long long>> == 2);

int main() {}
