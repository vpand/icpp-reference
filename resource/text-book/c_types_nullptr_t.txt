   Defined in header <stddef.h>
   typedef typeof(nullptr) nullptr_t;
                                     (since C23)

   nullptr_t is the type of the predefined null pointer constant, nullptr.
   It is a distinct type that is not itself a pointer type. It can be
   implicitly converted to any pointer type or bool, and the result is the
   null pointer value of that type or false respectively. No type other
   than nullptr_t itself can be converted or explicitly cast to nullptr_t.

   sizeof(nullptr_t) and alignof(nullptr_t) are equal to sizeof(void*) and
   alignof(void*) respectively.

   nullptr_t has only one valid value, i.e., nullptr. The object
   representation of nullptr is same as that of (void*)0. If a program
   produces a nullptr_t value with a different object representation, the
   behavior is undefined.

Example

   Demonstrate that nullptr_t is a distinct type.
   Run this code
#include <stddef.h>
#include <stdio.h>

#define DETECT_NULL_POINTER_CONSTANT(e) \
    _Generic(e,                         \
        void* : puts("void*"),          \
        nullptr_t : puts("nullptr_t"),  \
        default : puts("other")       \
    )

int main()
{
    DETECT_NULL_POINTER_CONSTANT(((void*)0));
    DETECT_NULL_POINTER_CONSTANT(0);
    DETECT_NULL_POINTER_CONSTANT(nullptr);
}

   Output:
void*
other
nullptr_t
