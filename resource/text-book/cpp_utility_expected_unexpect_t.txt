   Defined in header <expected>
   struct unexpect_t {

       explicit unexpect_t() = default;
   };
   (1)                                    (since C++23)
   inline constexpr unexpect_t unexpect{};
   (2)                                    (since C++23)
   1) A tag type for in-place construction of an unexpected value in an
   std::expected object.
   2) A constant of type const std::unexpect_t which is usually directly
   passed to a constructor of std::expected to construct an unexpected
   value.

Notes

   Like other construction tag types, unexpect_t is a trivial, empty class
   with an explicit default constructor.
