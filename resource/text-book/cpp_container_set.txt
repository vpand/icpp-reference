   Defined in header <set>
   template<

       class Key,
       class Compare = std::less<Key>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<Key>
   > class set;

   namespace pmr {

       template<
           class Key,
           class Compare = std::less<Key>
       > using set = std::set<Key, Compare,

   std::set is an associative container that contains a sorted set of
   unique objects of type Key. Sorting is done using the key comparison
   function Compare. Search, removal, and insertion operations have
   logarithmic complexity. Sets are usually implemented as Red-black
   trees.

   Everywhere the standard library uses the Compare requirements,
   uniqueness is determined by using the equivalence relation. In
   imprecise terms, two objects a and b are considered equivalent if
   neither compares less than the other: !comp(a, b) && !comp(b, a).

   std::set meets the requirements of Container, AllocatorAwareContainer,
   AssociativeContainer and ReversibleContainer.

Deduction guides

   (since C++17)

Notes

   The member types iterator and const_iterator may be aliases to the same
   type. This means defining a pair of function overloads using the two
   types as parameter types may violate the One Definition Rule. Since
   iterator is convertible to const_iterator, a single function with a
   const_iterator as parameter type will work instead.
