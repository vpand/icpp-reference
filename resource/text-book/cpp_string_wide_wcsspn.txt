   Defined in header <cwchar>
   size_t wcsspn( const wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src );

   Returns the length of the maximum initial segment of the wide string
   pointed to by dest, that consists of only the characters found in wide
   string pointed to by src.

Parameters

   dest - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be analyzed
   src - pointer to the null-terminated wide string that contains the
   characters to search for

Return value

   The length of the maximum initial segment that contains only characters
   from wide string pointed to by src.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

int main()
{
    wchar_t dest[] = L"½«  ²«";
    const wchar_t src[] = L" « ½ ";
    const std::size_t len = std::wcsspn(dest, src);
    dest[len] = L'\0'; // terminates the segment to print it out

    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    std::wcout << L"The length of maximum initial segment is " << len << L".\n";
    std::wcout << L"The segment is \"" << dest << L"\".\n";
}

   Possible output:
The length of maximum initial segment is 6.
The segment is "½«  ".
