       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>

       : public std::basic_streambuf<CharT, Traits>

   std::basic_stringbuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated
   character sequence is a memory-resident sequence of arbitrary
   characters, which can be initialized from or made available as an
   instance of std::basic_string.

   Typical implementations of std::basic_stringbuf hold an object of type
   std::basic_string or equivalent resizable sequence container directly
   as a data member and use it as both the controlled character sequence
   (the array where the six pointers of std::basic_streambuf are pointing
   to) and as the associated character sequence (the source of characters
   for all input operations and the target for the output).

   In addition, a typical implementation holds a data member of type
   std::ios_base::openmode to indicate the I/O mode of the associated
   stream (input-only, output-only, input/output, at-end, etc).

   If over-allocation strategy is used by overflow(), an additional
   high-watermark pointer may be stored to track the last initialized
   character.
   (since C++11)

   Several typedefs for common character types are provided:

   std::wstringbuf std::basic_stringbuf<wchar_t>
