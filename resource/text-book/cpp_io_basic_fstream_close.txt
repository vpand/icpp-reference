   void close();

   Closes the associated file.

   Effectively calls rdbuf()->close(). If an error occurs during
   operation, setstate(failbit) is called.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)

Notes

   This function is called by the destructor of basic_fstream when the
   stream object goes out of scope and is not usually invoked directly.

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::fstream f1("example1", std::ios::out),
                 f2("example2", std::ios::out),
                 f3("example3", std::ios::out);

    std::cout << std::boolalpha
              << f1.is_open() << '\n'
              << f2.is_open() << '\n'
              << f3.is_open() << '\n';

    f1.close();
    f2.close();

    std::cout << f1.is_open() << '\n'
              << f2.is_open() << '\n'
              << f3.is_open() << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
true
true
true
false
false
true
