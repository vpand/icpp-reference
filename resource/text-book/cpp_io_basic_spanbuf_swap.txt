   swap(std::basic_spanbuf)
   (C++23)

   void swap( basic_spanbuf& rhs );
                                   (since C++23)

   Swaps the state of *this and rhs.

   Calls std::basic_streambuf<Char, Traits>::swap(rhs), swaps the open
   mode of *this and rhs, and then makes them use the underlying buffer of
   each other.

Parameters

   rhs - another basic_stringbuf

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.

Notes

   This function is called automatically when swapping stream objects, it
   is rarely necessary to call it directly.
