   template< class... Args >
   iterator emplace( const_iterator pos, Args&&... args );
   (since C++11)
   (constexpr since C++20)

   Inserts a new element into the container directly before pos.

   The element is constructed through std::allocator_traits::construct,
   which typically uses placement-new to construct the element in-place at
   a location provided by the container. However, if the required location
   has been occupied by an existing element, the inserted element is
   constructed at another location at first, and then move assigned into
   the required location.

   The arguments args... are forwarded to the constructor as
   std::forward<Args>(args).... args... may directly or indirectly refer
   to a value in the container.

   If after the operation the new size() is greater than old capacity() a
   reallocation takes place, in which case all iterators (including the
   end() iterator) and all references to the elements are invalidated.
   Otherwise, only the iterators and references before the insertion point
   remain valid.

Parameters

   pos  - iterator before which the new element will be constructed
   args - arguments to forward to the constructor of the element
   Type requirements
   -
   T (the container's element type) must meet the requirements of
   MoveAssignable, MoveInsertable and EmplaceConstructible.

Return value

   Iterator pointing to the emplaced element.

Complexity

   Linear in the distance between pos and end of the container.

Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown other than by the copy constructor, move
   constructor, assignment operator, or move assignment operator of the
   value type, or if an exception is thrown while emplace is used to
   insert a single element at the end and the value type is either
   CopyInsertable or nothrow move constructible, there are no effects
   (strong exception guarantee).

   Otherwise, the effects are unspecified.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <vector>

struct A
{
    std::string s;

    A(std::string str) : s(std::move(str)) { std::cout << " constructed\n"; }

    A(const A& o) : s(o.s) { std::cout << " copy constructed\n"; }

    A(A&& o) : s(std::move(o.s)) { std::cout << " move constructed\n"; }

    A& operator=(const A& other)
    {
        s = other.s;
        std::cout << " copy assigned\n";
        return *this;
    }

    A& operator=(A&& other)
    {
        s = std::move(other.s);
        std::cout << " move assigned\n";
        return *this;
    }
};

int main()
{
    std::vector<A> container;
    // reserve enough place so vector does not have to resize
    container.reserve(10);
    std::cout << "construct 2 times A:\n";
    A two { "two" };
    A three { "three" };

    std::cout << "emplace:\n";
    container.emplace(container.end(), "one");

    std::cout << "emplace with A&:\n";
    container.emplace(container.end(), two);

    std::cout << "emplace with A&&:\n";
    container.emplace(container.end(), std::move(three));

    std::cout << "content:\n";
    for (const auto& obj : container)
        std::cout << ' ' << obj.s;
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Output:
construct 2 times A:
 constructed
 constructed
emplace:
 constructed
emplace with A&:
 copy constructed
emplace with A&&:
 move constructed
content:
 one two three
