   jmp_buf

   Defined in header <setjmp.h>
   typedef /* unspecified */ jmp_buf;

   The jmp_buf type is an array type suitable for storing information to
   restore a calling environment. The stored information is sufficient to
   restore execution at the correct block of the program and invocation of
   that block. The state of floating-point status flags, or open files, or
   any other data is not stored in an object of type jmp_buf.
