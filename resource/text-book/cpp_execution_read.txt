   Eager execution

   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto read( auto tag );
                                           (since C++26)

Parameters

   tag - by which the customization point is recognized

Return value

   Returns a sender that reaches into a receiver's environment and pulls
   out the current value associated with the customization point denoted
   by Tag.

Example

   Possible usage of tags in read function, to retrieve the value
   associated with the customization point.
execution::sender auto get_scheduler()
{
    return read(execution::get_scheduler);
}

execution::sender auto get_delegatee_scheduler()
{
    return read(execution::get_delegatee_scheduler);
}

execution::sender auto get_allocator()
{
    return read(execution::get_allocator);
}

execution::sender auto get_stop_token()
{
    return read(execution::get_stop_token);
}
