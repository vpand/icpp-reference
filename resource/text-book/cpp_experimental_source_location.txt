   std::experimental::source_location
   Creation
   source_location::source_location
   source_location::current
   Field Access
   source_location::line
   source_location::column
   source_location::file_name
   source_location::function_name

   Defined in header <experimental/source_location>
   struct source_location;
                                                   (library fundamentals TS v2)

   The source_location class represents certain information about the
   source code, such as file names, line numbers, and function names.
   Previously, functions that desire to obtain this information about the
   call site (for logging, testing, or debugging purposes) must use macros
   so that predefined macros like __LINE__ and __FILE__ are expanded in
   the context of the caller. The source_location class provides a better
   alternative.

Member functions

Creation

   (constructor)
   constructs a new source_location with implementation-defined values
   (public member function)
   current
   [static]
   constructs a new source_location
   (public static member function)

Other special member functions

   (destructor)
   (implicitly declared)
   destructs a source_location
   (public member function)
   operator=
   (implicitly declared)
   implicitly declared copy/move assignment operators
   (public member function)

Field access

   line
   return the line number represented by this object
   (public member function)
   column
   return the column number represented by this object
   (public member function)
   file_name
   return the file name represented by this object
   (public member function)
   function_name
   return the name of the function represented by this object, if any
   (public member function)

Example

   Run this code
#include <experimental/source_location>
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>

void log(const std::string_view message,
         const std::experimental::source_location location =
               std::experimental::source_location::current())
{
    std::cout << "info:"
              << location.file_name() << ':'
              << location.line() << ' '
              << message << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    log("Hello world!");
}

   Possible output:
info:main.cpp:15 Hello world!
