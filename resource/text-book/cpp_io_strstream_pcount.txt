   Member functions
   strstream::strstream
   strstream::~strstream
   strstream::rdbuf
   strstream::str
   strstream::pcount
   strstream::freeze

   int pcount() const;
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   Returns the number of characters that were output in the put area of
   the associated std::strstreambuf. Effectively calls rdbuf()->pcount().

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The number of characters in the put area, or zero if nothing was
   output.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    std::strstream dyn; // dynamically-allocated output buffer
    dyn << "Test: " << 1.23 << std::ends;
    std::cout << "The size of the output is " << dyn.pcount()
              << " and it holds \"" << dyn.str() << "\"\n";
    dyn.freeze(false);

    char buf[10];
    std::strstream user(buf, 10); // user-provided output buffer
    user << 1.23; // note: no std::ends
    std::cout.write(buf, user.pcount());
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Output:
The size of the output is 11 and it holds "Test: 1.23"
1.23
