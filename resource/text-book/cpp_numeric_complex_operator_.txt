   Assigns new values to the contents.
   1,2) Assigns cx.real() and cx.imag() to the real and the imaginary
   parts of the complex number respectively. The copy assignment operator
   (1) is trivial when T is a floating-point type.(since C++23)
   3) Assigns x to the real part of the complex number. Imaginary part is
   set to zero.

Parameters

   x  - value to assign
   cx - complex value to assign

Return value

   *this

Notes

   The copy assignment operator is required to be trivial since C++23, but
   implementations generally make it trivial in all modes.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
