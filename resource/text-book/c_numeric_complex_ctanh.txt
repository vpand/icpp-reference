   1-3) Computes the complex hyperbolic tangent of z.
   4) Type-generic macro: If z has type long double complex, ctanhl is
   called. if z has type double complex, ctanh is called, if z has type
   float complex, ctanhf is called. If z is real or integer, then the
   macro invokes the corresponding real function (tanhf, tanh, tanhl). If
   z is imaginary, then the macro invokes the corresponding real version
   of the function tan, implementing the formula tanh(iy) = i tan(y), and
   the return type is imaginary.

Parameters

   z - complex argument

Return value

   If no errors occur, complex hyperbolic tangent of z is returned

Error handling and special values

   Errors are reported consistent with math_errhandling

   If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic,
     * ctanh(conj(z)) == conj(ctanh(z))
     * ctanh(-z) == -ctanh(z)
     * If z is +0+0i, the result is +0+0i
     * If z is x+inftyi (for any^[1] finite x), the result is NaN+NaNi and
       FE_INVALID is raised
     * If z is x+NaN (for any^[2] finite x), the result is NaN+NaNi and
       FE_INVALID may be raised
     * If z is +infty+yi (for any finite positive y), the result is 1+0i
     * If z is +infty+inftyi, the result is 1±0i (the sign of the
       imaginary part is unspecified)
     * If z is +infty+NaNi, the result is 1±0i (the sign of the imaginary
       part is unspecified)
     * If z is NaN+0i, the result is NaN+0i
     * If z is NaN+yi (for any non-zero y), the result is NaN+NaNi and
       FE_INVALID may be raised
     * If z is NaN+NaNi, the result is NaN+NaNi

    1. ^| per DR471, this only holds for non-zero x. If z is 0+inftyi, the
       result should be 0+NaNi
    2. ^| per DR471, this only holds for non-zero x. If z is 0+NaNi, the
       result should be 0+NaNi

Notes

   Mathematical definition of hyperbolic tangent is tanh z =
   ez
   -e-z
   ez
   +e-z

   Hyperbolic tangent is an analytical function on the complex plane and
   has no branch cuts. It is periodic with respect to the imaginary
   component, with period pi, and has poles of the first order along the
   imaginary line, at coordinates (0, p(1/2 + n)). However no common
   floating-point representation is able to represent p/2 exactly, thus
   there is no value of the argument for which a pole error occurs.

Example

   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <math.h>
#include <complex.h>

int main(void)
{
    double complex z = ctanh(1);  // behaves like real tanh along the real line
    printf("tanh(1+0i) = %f%+fi (tanh(1)=%f)\n", creal(z), cimag(z), tanh(1));

    double complex z2 = ctanh(I); // behaves like tangent along the imaginary li
ne
    printf("tanh(0+1i) = %f%+fi ( tan(1)=%f)\n", creal(z2), cimag(z2), tan(1));
}

   Output:
tanh(1+0i) = 0.761594+0.000000i (tanh(1)=0.761594)
tanh(0+1i) = 0.000000+1.557408i ( tan(1)=1.557408)
