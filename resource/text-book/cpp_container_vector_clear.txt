   void clear();
   (noexcept since C++11)
   (constexpr since C++20)

   Erases all elements from the container. After this call, size() returns
   zero.

   Invalidates any references, pointers, and iterators referring to
   contained elements. Any past-the-end iterators are also invalidated.

   Leaves the capacity() of the vector unchanged (Note: the standard's
   restriction on the changes to capacity is in the specification of
   reserve(), see SO).

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   (none)

Complexity

   Linear in the size of the container, i.e., the number of elements.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <string_view>
#include <vector>

void print_info(std::string_view rem, const std::vector<int>& v)
{
    std::cout << rem << "{ ";
    for (const auto& value : v)
        std::cout << value << ' ';
    std::cout << "}\n";
    std::cout << "Size=" << v.size() << ", Capacity=" << v.capacity() << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> container{1, 2, 3};
    print_info("Before clear: ", container);
    container.clear();
    print_info("After clear: ", container);
}

   Output:
Before clear: { 1 2 3 }
Size=3, Capacity=3
After clear: { }
Size=0, Capacity=3

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 2231 C++11 complexity guarantee was mistakenly omitted in C++11
   complexity reaffirmed as linear
