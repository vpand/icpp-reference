   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class RandomIt >
   void nth_element( RandomIt first, RandomIt nth, RandomIt last );
   (1) (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class RandomIt >

   void nth_element( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                     RandomIt first, RandomIt nth, RandomIt last );
   (2) (since C++17)
   template< class RandomIt, class Compare >

   void nth_element( RandomIt first, RandomIt nth, RandomIt last,
                     Compare comp );
   (3) (constexpr since C++20)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class RandomIt, class Compare >

   void nth_element( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                     RandomIt first, RandomIt nth, RandomIt last,
                     Compare comp );
   (4) (since C++17)

   nth_element rearranges elements in [first, last) such that after the
   rearrangement:
     * The element pointed at by nth is changed to whatever element would
       occur in that position if [first, last) were sorted.
     * For every iterator i in [first, nth) and every iterator j in
       [nth, last), the following condition is met:

   1,2) bool(*j < *i)(until C++20)std::less{}(*j, *i)(since C++20) is
   false.
   3,4) bool(comp(*j, *i)) is false.

   1) Elements are hypothetically sorted with respect to operator<(until
   C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   3) Elements are hypothetically sorted with respect to comp.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * [first, nth) or [nth, last) is not a valid range.

     * The type of *first is not Swappable.

   (until C++11)
     * RandomIt is not ValueSwappable.
     * The type of *first is not MoveConstructible.
     * The type of *first is not MoveAssignable.

   (since C++11)

Parameters

   first, last - random access iterators defining the range sort
   nth - random access iterator defining the sort partition point
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
   requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
   less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

   bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

   While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not
   modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values
   of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
   (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is
   equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type RandomIt
   can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   RandomIt must meet the requirements of LegacyRandomAccessIterator.
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as last - first:
   1) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) comparisons using operator<(until
   C++20)std::less{}(since C++20) on average.
   2) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) comparisons using operator<(until
   C++20)std::less{}(since C++20), and \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot
   \log(N))\)O(N·log(N)) swaps.
   3) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) applications of the comparator comp on
   average.
   4) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) applications of the comparator comp, and
   \(\scriptsize O(N \cdot \log(N))\)O(N·log(N)) swaps.

Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Possible implementation

   See also the implementations in libstdc++, libc++, and msvc stl.

Notes

   The algorithm used is typically Introselect although other Selection
   algorithm with suitable average-case complexity are allowed.

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <cassert>
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

void printVec(const std::vector<int>& vec)
{
    std::cout << "v = {";
    for (char sep[]{0, ' ', 0}; const int i : vec)
        std::cout << sep << i, sep[0] = ',';
    std::cout << "};\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{5, 10, 6, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 9, 3};
    printVec(v);

    auto m = v.begin() + v.size() / 2;
    std::nth_element(v.begin(), m, v.end());
    std::cout << "\nThe median is " << v[v.size() / 2] << '\n';
    // The consequence of the inequality of elements before/after the Nth one:
    assert(std::accumulate(v.begin(), m, 0) < std::accumulate(m, v.end(), 0));
    printVec(v);

    // Note: comp function changed
    std::nth_element(v.begin(), v.begin() + 1, v.end(), std::greater{});
    std::cout << "\nThe second largest element is " << v[1] << '\n';
    std::cout << "The largest element is " << v[0] << '\n';
    printVec(v);
}

   Possible output:
v = {5, 10, 6, 4, 3, 2, 6, 7, 9, 3};

The median is 6
v = {3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 7, 9, 6};

The second largest element is 9
The largest element is 10
v = {10, 9, 6, 7, 6, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2};

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 2150 C++98 after the rearrangement, only one element before nth
   was required to be not greater than one element after nth corrected the
   requirement
   P0896R4 C++98 [first, nth) and [nth, last)
   were not required to be valid ranges the behavior is undefined
   if any of them is invalid
