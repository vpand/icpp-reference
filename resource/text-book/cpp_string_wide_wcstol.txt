   long long wcstoll( const wchar_t* str, wchar_t** str_end, int base );
   (since C++11)

   Interprets an integer value in a wide string pointed to by str.

   Discards any whitespace characters (as identified by calling
   std::iswspace) until the first non-whitespace character is found, then
   takes as many characters as possible to form a valid base-n (where
   n=base) integer number representation and converts them to an integer
   value. The valid integer value consists of the following parts:
     * (optional) plus or minus sign
     * (optional) prefix (0) indicating octal base (applies only when the
       base is 8 or 0)
     * (optional) prefix (0x or 0X) indicating hexadecimal base (applies
       only when the base is 16 or 0)
     * a sequence of digits

   The set of valid values for base is {0,2,3,...,36}. The set of valid
   digits for base-2 integers is {0,1}, for base-3 integers is {0,1,2},
   and so on. For bases larger than 10, valid digits include alphabetic
   characters, starting from Aa for base-11 integer, to Zz for base-36
   integer. The case of the characters is ignored.

   Additional numeric formats may be accepted by the currently installed C
   locale.

   If the value of base is 0, the numeric base is auto-detected: if the
   prefix is 0, the base is octal, if the prefix is 0x or 0X, the base is
   hexadecimal, otherwise the base is decimal.

   If the minus sign was part of the input sequence, the numeric value
   calculated from the sequence of digits is negated as if by unary minus
   in the result type.

   The functions sets the pointer pointed to by str_end to point to the
   wide character past the last character interpreted. If str_end is a
   null pointer, it is ignored.

Parameters

   str     - pointer to the null-terminated wide string to be interpreted
   str_end - pointer to a pointer to wide character
   base    - base of the interpreted integer value

Return value

   Integer value corresponding to the contents of str on success. If the
   converted value falls out of range of corresponding return type, range
   error occurs and LONG_MAX, LONG_MIN, LLONG_MAX or LLONG_MIN is
   returned. If no conversion can be performed, 0 is returned.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cwchar>
#include <errno.h>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    const wchar_t* p = L"10 200000000000000000000000000000 30 -40";
    wchar_t* end;
    std::wcout << "Parsing L'" << p << "':\n";
    for (long i = std::wcstol(p, &end, 10); p != end; i = std::wcstol(p, &end, 1
0))
    {
        std::wcout << '\'' << std::wstring(p, end-p) << "' -> ";
        p = end;
        if (errno == ERANGE)
        {
            std::wcout << "range error, got ";
            errno = 0;
        }
        std::wcout << i << '\n';
    }
}

   Possible output:
Parsing L'10 200000000000000000000000000000 30 -40':
'10' -> 10
' 200000000000000000000000000000' -> range error, got 9223372036854775807
' 30' -> 30
' -40' -> -40
