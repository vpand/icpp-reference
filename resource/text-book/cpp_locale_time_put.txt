   Defined in header <locale>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class OutputIt = std::ostreambuf_iterator<CharT>
   > class time_put;

   Class template std::time_put encapsulates date and time formatting
   rules. The I/O manipulator std::put_time uses the std::time_put facet
   of the I/O stream's locale to generate text representation of an
   std::tm object.

   Inheritance diagram

   If a std::time_put specialization is not guaranteed to be provided by
   the standard library (see below), the behaviors of its put() and
   do_put() are not guaranteed as specified.

Specializations

   The standard library is guaranteed to provide the following
   specializations (they are required to be implemented by any locale
   object):
   Defined in header <locale>
   std::time_put<char> creates narrow string representations of date and
   time
   std::time_put<wchar_t> creates wide string representations of date and
   time

   In addition, the standard library is also guaranteed to provide every
   specialization that satisfies the following type requirements:
     * CharT is one of char and wchar_t, and
     * OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.

Member types

   Member type Definition
   char_type   CharT
   iter_type   OutputIt

Member functions

   (constructor)
   constructs a new time_put facet
   (public member function)
   (destructor)
   destructs a time_put facet
   (protected member function)
   put
   invokes do_put
   (public member function)

Member objects

   static std::locale::id id
   id of the locale
   (public member object)

Protected member functions

   do_put
   [virtual]
   formats date/time and writes to output stream
   (virtual protected member function)

Example

   Run this code
#include <codecvt>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(std::cout.rdbuf());
    std::wostream out(&conv);
    out.imbue(std::locale("ja_JP.utf8"));

    // this I/O manipulator std::put_time uses std::time_put<wchar_t>
    out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
}

   Output:
´¥ 2011´1109¥ 123205
