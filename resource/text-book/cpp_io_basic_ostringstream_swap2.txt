   swap(std::basic_ostringstream)
   (C++11)

   Defined in header <sstream>
   template< class CharT, class Traits, class Alloc >

   void swap( std::basic_ostringstream<CharT,Traits,Alloc>& lhs,
              std::basic_ostringstream<CharT,Traits,Alloc>& rhs );
                                                     (since C++11)

   Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::basic_ostringstream.
   Exchanges the state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls
   lhs.swap(rhs).

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - streams whose state to swap

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
