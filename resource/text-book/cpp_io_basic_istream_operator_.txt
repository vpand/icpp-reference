   operator>>(std::basic_istream)

   protected:
   basic_istream& operator=( const basic_istream& rhs ) = delete;
   (1)
   protected:
   basic_istream& operator=( basic_istream&& rhs );
   (2)       (since C++11)
   1) The copy assignment operator is protected, and is deleted. Input
   streams are not CopyAssignable.
   2) The move assignment operator exchanges the gcount() values and all
   data members of the base class, except for rdbuf(), with rhs, as if by
   calling swap(*rhs). This move assignment operator is protected: it is
   only called by the move assignment operators of the derived movable
   input stream classes std::basic_ifstream and std::basic_istringstream,
   which know how to correctly move-assign the associated streambuffers.

Parameters

   rhs - the basic_istream object from which to assign to *this

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main()
{
    std::istringstream s1;
    s1 = std::istringstream("test"); // OK

//  std::cin = std::istringstream("test"); // ERROR: 'operator=' is protected
}
