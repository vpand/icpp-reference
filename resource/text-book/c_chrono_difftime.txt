   Defined in header <time.h>
   double difftime( time_t time_end, time_t time_beg );

   Computes difference between two calendar times as time_t objects
   (time_end - time_beg) in seconds. If time_end refers to time point
   before time_beg then the result is negative.

Parameters

   time_beg, time_end - times to compare

Return value

   Difference between two times in seconds.

Notes

   On POSIX systems, time_t is measured in seconds, and difftime is
   equivalent to arithmetic subtraction, but C and C++ allow fractional
   units for time_t.

Example

   The following program computes the number of seconds that have passed
   since the beginning of the month.
   Run this code
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>

int main(void)
{
    time_t now = time(0);

    struct tm beg = *localtime(&now);

    // set beg to the beginning of the month
    beg.tm_hour = 0,
    beg.tm_min = 0,
    beg.tm_sec = 0,
    beg.tm_mday = 1;

    double seconds = difftime(now, mktime(&beg));

    printf("%.f seconds have passed since the beginning of the month.\n", second
s);

    return 0;
}

   Output:
1937968 seconds have passed since the beginning of the month.
