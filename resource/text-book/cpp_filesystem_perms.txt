   Defined in header <filesystem>
   enum class perms;
                                 (since C++17)

   This type represents file access permissions.

   perms satisfies the requirements of BitmaskType (which means the
   bitwise operators operator&, operator|, operator^, operator~,
   operator&=, operator|=, and operator^= are defined for this type). none
   represents the empty bitmask; every other enumerator represents a
   distinct bitmask element.

   Access permissions model POSIX permission bits, and any individual file
   permissions (as reported by filesystem::status) are a combination of
   some of the following bits:

Member constants

   Member constant Value (octal) POSIX equivalent Meaning
   none 0 No permission bits are set
   owner_read 0400 S_IRUSR File owner has read permission
   owner_write 0200 S_IWUSR File owner has write permission
   owner_exec 0100 S_IXUSR File owner has execute/search permission
   owner_all 0700 S_IRWXU File owner has read, write, and execute/search
   permissions

   Equivalent to owner_read | owner_write | owner_exec
   group_read 040 S_IRGRP The file's user group has read permission
   group_write 020 S_IWGRP The file's user group has write permission
   group_exec 010 S_IXGRP The file's user group has execute/search
   permission
   group_all 070 S_IRWXG The file's user group has read, write, and
   execute/search permissions

   Equivalent to group_read | group_write | group_exec
   others_read 04 S_IROTH Other users have read permission
   others_write 02 S_IWOTH Other users have write permission
   others_exec 01 S_IXOTH Other users have execute/search permission
   others_all 07 S_IRWXO Other users have read, write, and execute/search
   permissions

   Equivalent to others_read | others_write | others_exec
   all 0777 All users have read, write, and execute/search permissions

   Equivalent to owner_all | group_all | others_all
   set_uid 04000 S_ISUID Set user ID to file owner user ID on execution
   set_gid 02000 S_ISGID Set group ID to file's user group ID on execution
   sticky_bit 01000 S_ISVTX Implementation-defined meaning, but POSIX XSI
   specifies that when set on a directory, only file owners may delete
   files even if the directory is writeable to others (used with /tmp)
   mask 07777 All valid permission bits.

   Equivalent to all | set_uid | set_gid | sticky_bit

   Additionally, the following constants of this type are defined, which
   do not represent permissions:
   Member constant Value (hex) Meaning
   unknown 0xFFFF Unknown permissions (e.g. when filesystem::file_status
   is created without permissions)

Notes

   Permissions may not necessarily be implemented as bits, but they are
   treated that way conceptually.

   Some permission bits may be ignored on some systems, and changing some
   bits may automatically change others (e.g. on platforms without
   owner/group/all distinction, setting any of the three write bits set
   all three).

Example

   Run this code
#include <filesystem>
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

void demo_perms(std::filesystem::perms p)
{
    using std::filesystem::perms;
    auto show = [=](char op, perms perm)
    {
        std::cout << (perms::none == (perm & p) ? '-' : op);
    };
    show('r', perms::owner_read);
    show('w', perms::owner_write);
    show('x', perms::owner_exec);
    show('r', perms::group_read);
    show('w', perms::group_write);
    show('x', perms::group_exec);
    show('r', perms::others_read);
    show('w', perms::others_write);
    show('x', perms::others_exec);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

int main()
{
    std::ofstream("test.txt"); // create file

    std::cout << "Created file with permissions: ";
    demo_perms(std::filesystem::status("test.txt").permissions());

    std::filesystem::permissions(
        "test.txt",
        std::filesystem::perms::owner_all | std::filesystem::perms::group_all,
        std::filesystem::perm_options::add
    );

    std::cout << "After adding u+rwx and g+rwx:  ";
    demo_perms(std::filesystem::status("test.txt").permissions());

    std::filesystem::remove("test.txt");
}

   Possible output:
Created file with permissions: rw-r--r--
After adding u+rwx and g+wrx:  rwxrwxr--
