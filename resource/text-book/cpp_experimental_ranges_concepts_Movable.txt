   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >

   concept bool Movable =
       std::is_object<T>::value &&
       MoveConstructible<T> &&
       Assignable<T&, T> &&
       Swappable<T>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept Movable<T> specifies that T is an object type that can
   moved (that is, it can be move constructed, move assigned, and lvalues
   of type T can be swapped).

   There need not be any subsumption relationship between Movable<T> and
   std::is_object<T>::value.
