   protected:
   virtual std::streamsize showmanyc()

   If implemented, returns the number of characters left to read from the
   file.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The number of characters available for reading from the file, or -1 if
   the end of file was reached.

Notes

   This function is optional. If not implemented, this function returns 0
   (since the base class version std::basic_streambuf::showmanyc gets
   called)

   Whether implemented or not, this function is normally called by
   std::basic_streambuf::in_avail if the get area is empty.

   The name of this function stands for "stream: how many characters?", so
   it is pronounced "S how many C", rather than "show many C"

Example

   implementation test to see if showmanyc() is implemented for filebuf
   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>

struct mybuf : std::filebuf
{
     using std::filebuf::showmanyc;
};

int main()
{
    mybuf fin;
    fin.open("main.cpp", std::ios_base::in);
    std::cout << "showmanyc() returns " << fin.showmanyc() << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
showmanyc() returns 267
