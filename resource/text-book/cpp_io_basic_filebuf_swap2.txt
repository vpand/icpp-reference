   swap(std::basic_filebuf)
   (C++11)

   template< class CharT, class Traits >

   void swap( std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits>& lhs,
              std::basic_filebuf<CharT,Traits>& rhs );
                                        (since C++11)

   Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::basic_filebuf. Exchanges the
   state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls lhs.swap(rhs).

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - std::basic_filebuf objects whose states to swap

Return value

   (none)
