   protected:
   virtual int_type underflow();
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   Reads the next character from the get area of the buffer.

   If the input sequence has a read position available (gptr() < egptr(),
   returns (unsigned char)(*gptr()).

   Otherwise, if pptr() is not null and pptr() > egptr() (there is a put
   area and it is located after the get area), extends the end of the get
   area to include the characters that were recently written into the put
   area by incrementing egptr() to some value between gptr() and pptr(),
   and then returns (unsigned char)(*gptr()).

   Otherwise, returns EOF to indicate failure.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The next character in the get area, (unsigned char)(*gptr()) on
   success, EOF on failure.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

struct mybuf : std::strstreambuf
{
    int_type overflow(int_type c)
    {
        std::cout << "Before overflow(): size of the get area is " << egptr()-eb
ack()
                  << " size of the put area is " << epptr()-pbase() << '\n';
        int_type rc = std::strstreambuf::overflow(c);
        std::cout << "After overflow(): size of the get area is " << egptr()-eba
ck()
                  << " size of the put area is " << epptr()-pbase() << '\n';
        return rc;
    }

    int_type underflow()
    {
        std::cout << "Before underflow(): size of the get area is " << egptr()-e
back()
                  << " size of the put area is " << epptr()-pbase() << '\n';
        int_type ch = std::strstreambuf::underflow();
        std::cout << "After underflow(): size of the get area is " << egptr()-eb
ack()
                  << " size of the put area is " << epptr()-pbase() << '\n';
        if (ch == EOF)
            std::cout << "underflow() returns EOF\n";
        else
            std::cout << "underflow() returns '" << char(ch) << "'\n";
        return ch;
    }
};

int main()
{
    mybuf sbuf; // read-write dynamic strstreambuf
    std::iostream stream(&sbuf);

    int n;
    stream >> n;
    stream.clear();
    stream << "123";
    stream >> n;
    std::cout << n << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
Before underflow(): size of the get area is 0 size of the put area is 0
After underflow(): size of the get area is 0 size of the put area is 0
underflow() returns EOF
Before overflow(): size of the get area is 0 size of the put area is 0
After overflow(): size of the get area is 0 size of the put area is 32
Before underflow(): size of the get area is 0 size of the put area is 32
After underflow(): size of the get area is 3 size of the put area is 32
underflow() returns '1'
Before underflow(): size of the get area is 3 size of the put area is 32
After underflow(): size of the get area is 3 size of the put area is 32
underflow() returns EOF
123
