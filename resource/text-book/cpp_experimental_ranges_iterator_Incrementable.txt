   concept bool Incrementable =
       Regular<I> &&
       WeaklyIncrementable<I> &&
       requires(I i) {
           { i++ } -> Same<I>&&;
       };
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept Incrementable<I> specifies the requirements on a type that
   can be incremented (with the pre- and post-increment operators). The
   increment operations (including those required by WeaklyIncrementable)
   are required to be equality-preserving, and the type is required to be
   EqualityComparable.

   Let a and b be incrementable objects of type I. Incrementable<I> is
   satisfied only if:
     * If bool(a == b) then bool(a++ == b).
     * If bool(a == b) then bool(void(a++), a) == ++b).

Equality preservation

   An expression is equality preserving if it results in equal outputs
   given equal inputs.
     * The inputs to an expression consist of its operands.
     * The outputs of an expression consist of its result and all operands
       modified by the expression (if any).

   Every expression required to be equality preserving is further required
   to be stable: two evaluations of such an expression with the same input
   objects must have equal outputs absent any explicit intervening
   modification of those input objects.

   Unless noted otherwise, every expression used in a requires-expression
   is required to be equality preserving and stable, and the evaluation of
   the expression may only modify its non-constant operands. Operands that
   are constant must not be modified.

Notes

   The requirement that a equals b implies ++a equals ++b allows the use
   of multi-pass algorithms with Incrementable types.
