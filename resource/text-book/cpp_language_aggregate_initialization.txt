Syntax

   T object = { arg1, arg2, ... };                   (1)
   T object { arg1, arg2, ... };                     (2) (since C++11)
   T object = { .des1 = arg1 , .des2 { arg2 } ... }; (3) (since C++20)
   T object { .des1 = arg1 , .des2 { arg2 } ... };   (4) (since C++20)
   1,2) Initializing an aggregate with an ordinary initializer list.
   3,4) Initializing an aggregate with designated initializers (aggregate
   class only).

Definitions

Aggregate

   An aggregate is one of the following types:
     * array types
     * class types that has

          + no user-declared constructors

   (until C++11)

          + no user-provided, inherited, or explicit constructors

   (since C++11)
   (until C++20)

          + no user-declared or inherited constructors

   (since C++20)

          + no private or protected direct(since C++17) non-static data
            members

          + no base classes

   (until C++17)

          + no virtual base classes
          + no private or protected direct base classes

   (since C++17)

          + no virtual member functions

          + no default member initializers

   (since C++11)
   (until C++14)

Element

   The elements of an aggregate are:
     * for an array, the array elements in increasing subscript order, or

     * for a class, the non-static data members that are not anonymous
       bit-fields, in declaration order.

   (until C++17)
     * for a class, the direct base classes in declaration order, followed
       by the direct non-static data members that are neither anonymous
       bit-fields nor members of an anonymous union, in declaration order.

   (since C++17)

Appertainment

   Each initializer clause in a brace-enclosed initializer list is said to
   appertain to an element of the aggregate being initialized or to an
   element of one of its subaggregates.

   Considering the sequence of initializer clauses, and the sequence of
   aggregate elements initially formed as the sequence of elements of the
   aggregate being initialized and potentially modified as described
   below:
     * For each initializer clause, if any of the following conditions is
       satisfied, it appertains to the corresponding aggregate element
       elem:

          + elem is not an aggregate.
          + The initializer clause begins with {.
          + The initializer clause is an expression, and an implicit
            conversion sequence can be formed that converts the expression
            to the type of elem.
          + elem is an aggregate that itself has no aggregate elements.

     * Otherwise, elem is an aggregate and that subaggregate is replaced
       in the list of aggregate elements by the sequence of its own
       aggregate elements, and the appertainment analysis resumes with the
       first such element and the same initializer clause. In other words,
       these rules apply recursively to the aggregate's subaggregates.

   The analysis is complete when all initializer clauses have been
   exhausted. If any initializer clause remains that does not appertain to
   an element of the aggregate or one of its subaggregates, the program is
   ill-formed.
struct S1 { int a, b; };
struct S2 { S1 s, t; };

// Each subaggregate of "x" is appertained to an initializer clause starting wit
h {
S2 x[2] =
{
    // appertains to "x[0]"
    {
        {1, 2}, // appertains to "x[0].s"
        {3, 4}  // appertains to "x[0].t"
    },
    // appertains to "x[1]"
    {
        {5, 6}, // appertains to "x[1].s"
        {7, 8}  // appertains to "x[1].t"
    }
};

// "x" and "y" have the same value (see below)
S2 y[2] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

// The process of the appertainment analysis of "y":
// 1. Initializes the aggregate element sequence (x[0], x[1]) and
//    the initializer clause sequence (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).
// 2. Starting from the first elements of each sequence,
//    checks whether 1 appertains to x[0]:
//    · x[0] is an aggregate.
//    · 1 does not begin with {.
//    · 1 is an expression, but it cannot be implicitly converted to S2.
//    · x[0] has aggregate elements.
// 3. 0 cannot appertain to x[0], therefore x[0] is replaced by x[0].s and x[0].
t,
//    the aggregate element sequence becomes (x[0].s, x[0].t, x[1]).
// 4. Resumes the appertainment check, but 1 cannot appertain to x[0].s either.
// 5. The aggregate element sequence now becomes (x[0].s.a, x[0].s.b, x[0].t, x[
1]).
// 6. Resumes the appertainment check again:
//    1 appertains to x[0].s.a, and 2 appertains to x[0].s.b.
// 7. The rest of the appertainment analysis works similarly.

char cv[4] = {'a', 's', 'd', 'f', 0}; // Error: too many initializer clauses

Initialization process

Determining element kind

   The effects of aggregate initialization are:
   1) Determine the explicitly initialized elements of the aggregate as
   follows:

          + If the initializer list is a designated initializer list (the
            aggregate can only be of class type), the identifier in each
            designator shall name a direct non-static data member of the
            class, and the explicitly initialized elements of the
            aggregate are the elements that are, or contain, those
            members.

   (since C++20)

          + Otherwise, if the initializer list is non-empty, the
            explicitly initialized elements of the aggregate are the
            elements with an appertained initializer clause and the
            elements having a subaggregate with an appertained initializer
            clause.
          + Otherwise, the initializer list must be empty ({}), and there
            are no explicitly initialized elements.

          The program is ill-formed if the aggregate is a union and there
          are two or more explicitly initialized elements:

union u { int a; const char* b; };

u a = {1};                   // OK: explicitly initializes member `a`
u b = {0, "asdf"};           // error: explicitly initializes two members
u c = {"asdf"};              // error: int cannot be initialized by "asdf"

// C++20 designated initializer lists
u d = {.b = "asdf"};         // OK: can explicitly initialize a non-initial memb
er
u e = {.a = 1, .b = "asdf"}; // error: explicitly initializes two members

   2) Initialize each element of the aggregate in the element order. That
   is, all value computations and side effects associated with a given
   element are sequenced before those of any element that follows it in
   order(since C++11).

Explicitly initialized elements

   For each explicitly initialized element:
     * If the element is an anonymous union member and the initializer
       list is a designated initializer list, the element is initialized
       by the designated initializer list {D}, where D is the designated
       initializer clause naming a member of the anonymous union member.
       There shall be only one such designated initializer clause.

struct C
{
    union
    {
        int a;
        const char* p;
    };

    int x;
} c = {.a = 1, .x = 3}; // initializes c.a with 1 and c.x with 3

     * Otherwise, if the initializer list is a designated initializer
       list, the element is initialized with the initializer of the
       corresponding designated initializer clause.

          + If that initializer is of syntax (1), and a narrowing
            conversion is required to convert the expression, the program
            is ill-formed.

   (since C++20)

     * The initializer list is a brace-enclosed initializer list:

   (until C++20)
     * Otherwise, the initializer list is a non-designated brace-enclosed
       initializer list:

   (since C++20)

          + If an initializer clause appertains to the aggregate element,
            then the aggregate element is copy-initialized from the
            initializer clause.
          + Otherwise, the aggregate element is copy-initialized from a
            brace-enclosed initializer list consisting of all of the
            initializer clauses that appertain to subobjects of the
            aggregate element, in the order of appearance.

struct A
{
    int x;

    struct B
    {
        int i;
        int j;
    } b;
} a = {1, {2, 3}}; // initializes a.x with 1, a.b.i with 2, a.b.j with 3

struct base1 { int b1, b2 = 42; };

struct base2
{
    base2()
    {
        b3 = 42;
    }

    int b3;
};

struct derived : base1, base2
{
    int d;
};

derived d1{{1, 2}, {}, 4}; // initializes d1.b1 with 1, d1.b2 with 2,
                           //             d1.b3 with 42, d1.d with 4
derived d2{{}, {}, 4};     // initializes d2.b1 with 0, d2.b2 with 42,
                           //             d2.b3 with 42, d2.d with 4

Implicitly initialized elements

   For a non-union aggregate, each element that is not an explicitly
   initialized element is initialized as follows:
     * If the element has a default member initializer, the element is
       initialized from that initializer.

   (since C++11)
     * Otherwise, if the element is not a reference, the element is
       copy-initialized from an empty initializer list.
     * Otherwise, the program is ill-formed.

struct S
{
    int a;
    const char* b;
    int c;
    int d = b[a];
};

// initializes ss.a with 1,
//             ss.b with "asdf",
//             ss.c with the value of an expression of the form int{} (that is,
0),
//         and ss.d with the value of ss.b[ss.a] (that is, 's')
S ss = {1, "asdf"};

   If the aggregate is a union and the initializer list is empty, then
     * If any variant member has a default member initializer, that member
       is initialized from its default member initializer.

   (since C++11)
     * Otherwise, the first member of the union (if any) is
       copy-initialized from an empty initializer list.

Arrays with unknown bounds

   The number of elements in an array of unknown bound initialized with a
   brace-enclosed initializer list is the number of explicitly initialized
   elements of the array. An array of unknown bound cannot be initialized
   with {}.
int x[] = {1, 3, 5}; // x has 3 elements

struct Y { int i, j, k; };

Y y[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; // y has only 2 elements:
                            // 1, 2 and 3 appertain to y[0],
                            // 4, 5 and 6 appertain to y[1]

int z[] = {} // Error: cannot declare an array without any element

Designated initializers

   The syntax forms (3,4) are known as designated initializers: each
   designator must name a direct non-static data member of T, and all
   designator¿s used in the expression must appear in the same order as
   the data members of T.
struct A { int x; int y; int z; };

A a{.y = 2, .x = 1}; // error; designator order does not match declaration order
A b{.x = 1, .z = 2}; // ok, b.y initialized to 0

   Each direct non-static data member named by the designated initializer
   is initialized from the corresponding brace-or-equals initializer that
   follows the designator. Narrowing conversions are prohibited.

   Designated initializer can be used to initialize a union into the state
   other than the first. Only one initializer may be provided for a union.
union u { int a; const char* b; };

u f = {.b = "asdf"};         // OK, active member of the union is b
u g = {.a = 1, .b = "asdf"}; // Error, only one initializer may be provided

   For a non-union aggregate, elements for which a designated initializer
   is not provided are initialized the same as described above for when
   the number of initializer clauses is less than the number of members
   (default member initializers where provided, empty list-initialization
   otherwise):
struct A
{
    string str;
    int n = 42;
    int m = -1;
};

A{.m = 21} // Initializes str with {}, which calls the default constructor
           // then initializes n with = 42
           // then initializes m with = 21

   If the aggregate that is initialized with a designated initializer
   clause has an anonymous union member, the corresponding designated
   initializer must name one of the members of that anonymous union.

   Note: out-of-order designated initialization, nested designated
   initialization, mixing of designated initializers and regular
   initializers, and designated initialization of arrays are all supported
   in the C programming language, but are not allowed in C++.
struct A { int x, y; };
struct B { struct A a; };

struct A a = {.y = 1, .x = 2}; // valid C, invalid C++ (out of order)
int arr[3] = {[1] = 5};        // valid C, invalid C++ (array)
struct B b = {.a.x = 0};       // valid C, invalid C++ (nested)
struct A a = {.x = 1, 2};      // valid C, invalid C++ (mixed)

   (since C++20)

Character arrays

   Arrays of ordinary character types (char, signed char, unsigned char),
   char8_t(since C++20), char16_t, char32_t(since C++11), or wchar_t can
   be initialized from ordinary string literals, UTF-8 string
   literals(since C++20), UTF-16 string literals, UTF-32 string
   literals(since C++11), or wide string literals, respectively,
   optionally enclosed in braces. Additionally, an array of char or
   unsigned char may be initialized by a UTF-8 string literal, optionally
   enclosed in braces(since C++20). Successive characters of the string
   literal (which includes the implicit terminating null character)
   initialize the elements of the array, with an integral conversion if
   necessary for the source and destination value(since C++20). If the
   size of the array is specified and it is larger than the number of
   characters in the string literal, the remaining characters are
   zero-initialized.
char a[] = "abc";
// equivalent to char a[4] = {'a', 'b', 'c', '\0'};

//  unsigned char b[3] = "abc"; // Error: initializer string too long
unsigned char b[5]{"abc"};
// equivalent to unsigned char b[5] = {'a', 'b', 'c', '\0', '\0'};

wchar_t c[] = {L"koshka"}; // optional braces
// equivalent to wchar_t c[6] = {L'k', L'o', L'sh', L'k', L'a', L'\0'};

Notes

   An aggregate class or array may include non-aggregate public
   bases(since C++17), members, or elements, which are initialized as
   described above (e.g. copy-initialization from the corresponding
   initializer clause).

   Until C++11, narrowing conversions were permitted in aggregate
   initialization, but they are no longer allowed.

   Until C++11, aggregate initialization could only be used in variable
   definition, and could not be used in a constructor initializer list, a
   new-expression, or temporary object creation due to syntax
   restrictions.

   In C, character array of size one less than the size of the string
   literal may be initialized from a string literal; the resulting array
   is not null-terminated. This is not allowed in C++.
