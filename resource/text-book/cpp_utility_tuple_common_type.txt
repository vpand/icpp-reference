   Defined in header <tuple>
   template< tuple-like TTuple, tuple-like UTuple >

       requires /* see below */
   struct common_type<TTuple, UTuple>;
                                                   (since C++23)

   The common type of two tuple-like types is a std::tuple consists of the
   common types of all corresponding element type pairs of both types.

   Given
     * TTypes as the pack formed by the sequence of
       std::tuple_element_t<i, TTuple> for every integer i in
       [0, std::tuple_size_v<TTuple>), and
     * UTypes as the pack formed by the sequence of
       std::tuple_element_t<i, UTuple> for every integer i in
       [0, std::tuple_size_v<UTuple>),

   the following constraints need to be satisfied:
     * TTuple or UTuple is a std::tuple specialization.
     * std::is_same_v<TTuple, std::decay_t<TTuple>> is true.
     * std::is_same_v<UTuple, std::decay_t<UTuple>> is true.
     * std::tuple_size_v<TTuple> equals std::tuple_size_v<UTuple> (TTuple
       and UTuple have the same number of elements).
     * std::tuple<std::common_type_t<TTypes, UTypes>...> denotes a type.
