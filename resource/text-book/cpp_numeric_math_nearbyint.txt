   Defined in header <cmath>
   template< class Integer >
   double      nearbyint ( Integer num );
   (A)
   1-3) Rounds the floating-point argument num to an integer value in
   floating-point format, using the current rounding mode. The library
   provides overloads of std::nearbyint for all cv-unqualified
   floating-point types as the type of the parameter.(since C++23)
   A) Additional overloads are provided for all integer types, which are
   treated as double.
   (since C++11)

Parameters

   num - floating-point or integer value

Return value

   The nearest integer value to num, according to the current rounding
   mode, is returned.

Error handling

   This function is not subject to any of the errors specified in
   math_errhandling.

   If the implementation supports IEEE floating-point arithmetic (IEC
   60559),
     * FE_INEXACT is never raised.
     * If num is ±infty, it is returned, unmodified.
     * If num is ±0, it is returned, unmodified.
     * If num is NaN, NaN is returned.

Notes

   The only difference between std::nearbyint and std::rint is that
   std::nearbyint never raises FE_INEXACT.

   The largest representable floating-point values are exact integers in
   all standard floating-point formats, so std::nearbyint never overflows
   on its own; however the result may overflow any integer type (including
   std::intmax_t), when stored in an integer variable.

   If the current rounding mode is FE_TONEAREST, this function rounds to
   even in halfway cases (like std::rint, but unlike std::round).

   The additional overloads are not required to be provided exactly as
   (A). They only need to be sufficient to ensure that for their argument
   num of integer type, std::nearbyint(num) has the same effect as
   std::nearbyint(static_cast<double>(num)).

Example

   Run this code
#include <cfenv>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#pragma STDC FENV_ACCESS ON

int main()
{
    std::fesetround(FE_TONEAREST);
    std::cout << "rounding to nearest: \n"
              << "nearbyint(+2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(2.3)
              << "  nearbyint(+2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(2.5)
              << "  nearbyint(+3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(3.5) << '\n'
              << "nearbyint(-2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.3)
              << "  nearbyint(-2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.5)
              << "  nearbyint(-3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-3.5) << '\n';

    std::fesetround(FE_DOWNWARD);
    std::cout << "rounding down:\n"
              << "nearbyint(+2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(2.3)
              << "  nearbyint(+2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(2.5)
              << "  nearbyint(+3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(3.5) << '\n'
              << "nearbyint(-2.3) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.3)
              << "  nearbyint(-2.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-2.5)
              << "  nearbyint(-3.5) = " << std::nearbyint(-3.5) << '\n';

    std::cout << "nearbyint(-0.0) = " << std::nearbyint(-0.0)  << '\n'
              << "nearbyint(-Inf) = " << std::nearbyint(-INFINITY) << '\n';
}

   Output:
rounding to nearest:
nearbyint(+2.3) = 2  nearbyint(+2.5) = 2  nearbyint(+3.5) = 4
nearbyint(-2.3) = -2  nearbyint(-2.5) = -2  nearbyint(-3.5) = -4
rounding down:
nearbyint(+2.3) = 2  nearbyint(+2.5) = 2  nearbyint(+3.5) = 3
nearbyint(-2.3) = -3  nearbyint(-2.5) = -3  nearbyint(-3.5) = -4
nearbyint(-0.0) = -0
nearbyint(-Inf) = -inf
