   template< class CharT, class Traits, class Allocator >

   void swap( std::basic_syncbuf<CharT, Traits, Allocator>& lhs,
              std::basic_syncbuf<CharT, Traits, Allocator>& rhs );
                                                         (since C++20)

   Overloads the std::swap algorithm for std::basic_syncbuf. Exchanges the
   state of lhs with that of rhs. Effectively calls lhs.swap(rhs).

Parameters

   lhs, rhs - std::basic_syncbuf objects whose states to swap

Return value

   (none)
