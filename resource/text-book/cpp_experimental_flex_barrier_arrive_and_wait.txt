   void arrive_and_wait();
                          (concurrency TS)

   Blocks and arrives at the flex_barrier's synchronization point.

   The behavior is undefined if the calling thread is not in the set of
   participating threads of this flex_barrier.

   Calls to arrive_and_wait synchronizes with the start of the completion
   phase of the flex_barrier. The completion of the completion phase
   synchronizes with the return from the call.

   Calls to arrive_and_drop and arrive_and_wait never introduce data races
   with themselves or each other.

Notes

   It is safe for a thread to call either arrive_and_wait() or
   arrive_and_drop() immediately on return from this call (provided that
   the function object for the completion phase did not return zero). It's
   not necessary to ensure that all blocked threads have exited
   arrive_and_wait() before a thread calls it again.

   The completion phase executes the function object specified when the
   flex_barrier was constructed. If it returns -1, the set of
   participating threads is unchanged; otherwise, the set of participating
   threads is a new set with the size equal to the return value N, and
   consists of the next N threads to arrive at the synchronization point.
   If N == 0, the flex_barrier can only be destroyed.

   The initial set of participating threads for a flex_barrier constructed
   for num_threads threads is the first num_threads to arrive at its
   synchronization point.

Exceptions

   Throws nothing.
