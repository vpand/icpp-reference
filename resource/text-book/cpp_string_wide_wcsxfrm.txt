   Defined in header <cwchar>
   std::size_t wcsxfrm( wchar_t* dest, const wchar_t* src, std::size_t
   count );

   Transforms the null-terminated wide string pointed to by src into the
   implementation-defined form such that comparing two transformed strings
   with std::wcscmp gives the same result as comparing the original
   strings with std::wcscoll, in the current C locale.

   The first count characters of the transformed string are written to
   destination, including the terminating null character, and the length
   of the full transformed string is returned, excluding the terminating
   null character.

   If count is 0, then dest is allowed to be a null pointer.

Notes

   The correct length of the buffer that can receive the entire
   transformed string is 1 + std::wcsxfrm(nullptr, src, 0).

   This function is used when making multiple locale-dependent comparisons
   using the same wide string or set of wide strings, because it is more
   efficient to use std::wcsxfrm to transform all the strings just once,
   and subsequently compare the transformed wide strings with std::wcscmp.

Parameters

   dest - pointer to the first element of a wide null-terminated string to
   write the transformed string to
   src - pointer to the null-terminated wide character string to transform
   count - maximum number of characters to output

Return value

   The length of the transformed wide string, not including the
   terminating null-character.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "sv_SE.utf8");

    std::wstring in1 = L"\u00e5r";
    std::wstring out1(1 + std::wcsxfrm(nullptr, in1.c_str(), 0), L' ');
    std::wstring in2 = L"\u00e4ngel";
    std::wstring out2(1 + std::wcsxfrm(nullptr, in2.c_str(), 0), L' ');

    std::wcsxfrm(&out1[0], in1.c_str(), out1.size());
    std::wcsxfrm(&out2[0], in2.c_str(), out2.size());

    std::wcout << "In the Swedish locale: ";
    if (out1 < out2)
        std::wcout << in1 << " before " << in2 << '\n';
    else
        std::wcout << in2 << " before " << in1 << '\n';

    std::wcout << "In lexicographical comparison: ";
    if (in1 < in2)
        std::wcout << in1 << " before " << in2 << '\n';
    else
        std::wcout << in2 << " before " << in1 << '\n';

}

   Output:
In the Swedish locale: år before ängel
In lexicographical comparison: ängel before år
