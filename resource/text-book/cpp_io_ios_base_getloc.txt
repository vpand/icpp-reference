   std::locale getloc() const;

   Returns the current locale associated with the stream.

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   The locale object associated with the stream.

Example

   The output shown was obtained using the clang compiler.
   Run this code
#include <codecvt>
#include <ctime>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::wbuffer_convert<std::codecvt_utf8<wchar_t>> conv(std::cout.rdbuf());
    std::wostream out(&conv);

    out.imbue(std::locale(out.getloc(),
                          new std::time_put_byname<wchar_t>("ja_JP.utf8")));

    std::time_t t = std::time(nullptr);
    out << std::put_time(std::localtime(&t), L"%A %c") << '\n';
}

   Possible output:
