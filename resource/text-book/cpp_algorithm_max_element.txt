   Defined in header <algorithm>
   template< class ForwardIt >
   ForwardIt max_element( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last );
   (1) (constexpr since C++17)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt >

   ForwardIt max_element( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                          ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last );
   (2) (since C++17)
   template< class ForwardIt, class Compare >

   ForwardIt max_element( ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,
                          Compare comp );
   (3) (constexpr since C++17)
   template< class ExecutionPolicy, class ForwardIt, class Compare >

   ForwardIt max_element( ExecutionPolicy&& policy,
                          ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last,
                          Compare comp );
   (4) (since C++17)

   Finds the greatest element in the range [first, last).
   1) Elements are compared using operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since
   C++20).
   3) Elements are compared using the comparison function comp.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

Parameters

   first, last - forward iterators defining the range to examine
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
   requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
   less than the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

   bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

   While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not
   modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values
   of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
   (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is
   equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type ForwardIt
   can be dereferenced and then implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   ForwardIt must meet the requirements of LegacyForwardIterator.

Return value

   Iterator to the greatest element in the range [first, last). If several
   elements in the range are equivalent to the greatest element, returns
   the iterator to the first such element. Returns last if the range is
   empty.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):
   1,2) Exactly \(\scriptsize \max(N-1,0)\)max(N-1,0) comparisons using
   operator<(until C++20)std::less{}(since C++20).
   3,4) Exactly \(\scriptsize \max(N-1,0)\)max(N-1,0) applications of the
   comparison function comp.

Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Possible implementation

               max_element (1)
template<class ForwardIt>
ForwardIt max_element(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last)
{
    if (first == last)
        return last;

    ForwardIt largest = first;

    while (++first != last)
        if (*largest < *first)
            largest = first;

    return largest;
}

               max_element (3)
template<class ForwardIt, class Compare>
ForwardIt max_element(ForwardIt first, ForwardIt last, Compare comp)
{
    if (first == last)
        return last;

    ForwardIt largest = first;

    while(++first != last)
        if (comp(*largest, *first))
            largest = first;

    return largest;
}

Example

   Run this code
#include <algorithm>
#include <cmath>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector<int> v{3, 1, -14, 1, 5, 9, -14, 9};
    std::vector<int>::iterator result;

    result = std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end());
    std::cout << "Max element found at index "
              << std::distance(v.begin(), result)
              << " has value " << *result << '\n';

    result = std::max_element(v.begin(), v.end(), [](int a, int b)
    {
        return std::abs(a) < std::abs(b);
    });
    std::cout << "Absolute max element found at index "
              << std::distance(v.begin(), result)
              << " has value " << *result << '\n';
}

   Output:
Max element found at index 5 has value 9
Absolute max element found at index 2 has value -14

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 212 C++98 the return value was not specified if [first, last) is
   empty returns last in this case
   LWG 2150 C++98 the iterator to the first non-smallest element was
   returned corrected the return value
