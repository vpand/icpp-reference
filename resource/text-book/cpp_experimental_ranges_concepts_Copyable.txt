   Defined in header <experimental/ranges/concepts>
   template< class T >

   concept bool Copyable =
       CopyConstructible<T> &&
       Movable<T> &&
       Assignable<T&, const T&>;
                                                   (ranges TS)

   The concept Copyable<T> specifies that T is an Movable object type that
   can also copied (that is, it supports copy construction and copy
   assignment).

Notes

   It is intended that Copyable<T> also requires Assignable<T&, const T>
   (assignment from const rvalue) and Assignable<T&, T&> (assignment from
   non-const lvalue) to be satisfied.
