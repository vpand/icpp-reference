   Defined in header <locale>
   public:
   const CharT* scan_is( mask m, const CharT* beg, const CharT* end )
   const;
   (1)
   protected:
   virtual const CharT* do_scan_is( mask m, const CharT* beg, const CharT*
   end ) const;
   (2)
   1) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function
   do_scan_is of the most derived class.
   2) Locates the first character in the character array [beg, end) that
   satisfies the classification mask m, that is, the first character c
   such that is(m, c) would return true.

Parameters

   m - mask to search for
   beg - pointer to the first character in an array of characters to
   search
   end - one past the end pointer for the array of characters to search

Return value

   Pointer to the first character in [beg, end) that satisfies the mask,
   or end if no such character was found.

Example

   Run this code
#include <clocale>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <locale>

int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "en_US.utf8");
    std::wcout.imbue(std::locale("en_US.utf8"));
    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::ctype<wchar_t>>(std::wcout.getloc());

    // skip until the first letter
    wchar_t s1[] = L"      \t\t\n  Koshka";
    const wchar_t* p1 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s1), std::e
nd(s1));
    std::wcout << '\'' << p1 << "'\n";

    // skip until the first letter
    wchar_t s2[] = L"123456789NePuNePu";
    const wchar_t* p2 = f.scan_is(std::ctype_base::alpha, std::begin(s2), std::e
nd(s2));
    std::wcout << '\'' << p2 << "'\n";
}

   Output:
'Koshka'
'NePuNePu'

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 152 C++98 the effect of do_scan_is mentioned is(m),
   but is does not have such an overload corrected to is(m, c)
