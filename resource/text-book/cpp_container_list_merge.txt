   void merge( list& other );
   (1)
   void merge( list&& other );
   (2)                        (since C++11)
   template< class Compare >
   void merge( list& other, Compare comp );
   (3)
   template< class Compare >
   void merge( list&& other, Compare comp );
   (4)                        (since C++11)

   The function does nothing if other refers to the same object as *this.

   Otherwise, merges other into *this. Both lists should be sorted. No
   elements are copied, and the container other becomes empty after the
   merge. This operation is stable: for equivalent elements in the two
   lists, the elements from *this always precede the elements from other,
   and the order of equivalent elements of *this and other does not
   change.

   No iterators or references become invalidated. The pointers and
   references to the elements moved from *this, as well as the iterators
   referring to these elements, will refer to the same elements of *this,
   instead of other.
   1,2) Elements are compared using operator<.
   3,4) Elements are compared using comp.

   If *this or other is not sorted with respected to the corresponding
   comparator, or get_allocator() != other.get_allocator(), the behavior
   is undefined.

Parameters

   other - another container to merge
   comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
   requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
   less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

   bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

   While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not
   modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values
   of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
   (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is
   equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type
   list<T,&nbsp;Allocator>::const_iterator can be dereferenced and then
   implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

Return value

   (none)

Exceptions

   If an exception is thrown for any reason, these functions have no
   effect (strong exception safety guarantee). Except if the exception
   comes from a comparison.

Complexity

   If other refers to the same object as *this, no comparisons are
   performed.

   Otherwise, given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(begin(), end())
   and \(\scriptsize R\)R as std::distance(other.begin(), other.end()):
   1,2) At most \(\scriptsize N+R-1\)N+R-1 comparisons using operator<.
   3,4) At most \(\scriptsize N+R-1\)N+R-1 applications of the comparison
   function comp.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const std::list<int>& list)
{
    for (const int i : list)
        ostr << ' ' << i;
    return ostr;
}

int main()
{
    std::list<int> list1 = {5, 9, 1, 3, 3};
    std::list<int> list2 = {8, 7, 2, 3, 4, 4};

    list1.sort();
    list2.sort();
    std::cout << "list1: " << list1 << '\n';
    std::cout << "list2: " << list2 << '\n';

    list1.merge(list2);
    std::cout << "merged:" << list1 << '\n';
}

   Output:
list1:  1 3 3 5 9
list2:  2 3 4 4 7 8
merged: 1 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 7 8 9

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 300 C++98 the effect when *this and other refer
   to the same object was not specified specified as no-op
   LWG 1207 C++98 it was unclear whether iterators and/or references will
   be invalidated keep valid
   LWG 1215 C++98 O(1) node moving could not be guaranteed if
   get_allocator() != other.get_allocator() the behavior is
   undefined in this case
