   Eager execution

   Defined in header <execution>
   execution::sender auto transfer(

       execution::sender auto input,
       execution::scheduler auto scheduler
   );

Parameters

   input     - sender to be transfered on the scheduler
   scheduler - scheduler on which the sender will run

Return value

   Returns a sender describing the transition from the execution agent of
   the input sender to the execution agent of the target scheduler.

Example

   Possible usage of execution::transfer.
execution::scheduler auto cpu_sched = get_system_thread_pool().scheduler();
execution::scheduler auto gpu_sched = cuda::scheduler();

execution::sender auto cpu_task = execution::schedule(cpu_sched);
// cpu_task describes the creation of a new task on the system thread pool

execution::sender auto gpu_task = execution::transfer(cpu_task, gpu_sched);
// gpu_task describes the transition of the task graph described by cpu_task to
the GPU
