   boolean-testable

   template< class B >
   concept __boolean_testable_impl = std::convertible_to<B, bool>;
                      (exposition only*)
   template< class B >

   concept boolean-testable =
       __boolean_testable_impl<B> &&
       requires (B&& b) {
           { !std::forward<B>(b) } -> __boolean_testable_impl;
       };
                      (exposition only*)

   The exposition-only concept boolean-testable specifies the requirements
   for expressions that are convertible to bool and for which the logical
   operators have the usual behavior (including short-circuiting), even
   for two different boolean-testable types.

   Formally, to model the exposition-only concept __boolean_testable_impl,
   the type must not define any member operator&& and operator||, and no
   viable non-member operator&& and operator|| may be visible by
   argument-dependent lookup. Additionally, given an expression e such
   that decltype((e)) is B, boolean-testable is modeled only if bool(e) ==
   !bool(!e).

Equality preservation

   Expressions declared in requires expressions of the standard library
   concepts are required to be equality-preserving (except where stated
   otherwise).

Notes

   Examples of boolean-testable types include bool, std::true_type,
   std::bitset<N>::reference, and int*.
