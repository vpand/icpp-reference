   Defined in header <concepts>
   template< class R, class T, class U >

   concept relation =
       std::predicate<R, T, T> && std::predicate<R, U, U> &&
       std::predicate<R, T, U> && std::predicate<R, U, T>;
   (1)                                  (since C++20)

   The concept relation<R, T, U> specifies that R defines a binary
   relation over the set of expressions whose type and value category are
   those encoded by either T or U.
