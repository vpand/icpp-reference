   protected:

   virtual pos_type seekpos( pos_type sp,
                             std::ios_base::openmode which =
   std::ios_base::in | std::ios_base::out );

   Repositions std::basic_streambuf::gptr and/or
   std::basic_streambuf::pptr, if possible, to the position indicated by
   sp.

   Effectively executes seekoff(off_type(sp), std::ios_base::beg, which).

Parameters

   sp - stream position, such as one obtained by seekoff() or seekpos()
   which - defines whether the input sequences, the output sequence, or
   both are affected. It can be one or a combination of the following
   constants:
   Constant Explanation
   in       affect the input sequence
   out      affect the output sequence

Return value

   sp on success or pos_type(off_type(-1)) on failure.

Notes

   seekpos() is called by std::basic_streambuf::pubseekpos(), which is
   called by the single-argument versions of std::basic_istream::seekg()
   and std::basic_ostream::seekp().

Example

   Run this code
#include <sstream>
#include <iostream>

struct mybuf : std::stringbuf
{
    mybuf(const std::string& str) : std::stringbuf(str) {}

    pos_type seekpos(pos_type sp, std::ios_base::openmode which)
    {
        std::cout << "Before seekpos(" << sp << "), size of the get area is "
                  << egptr() - eback() << " with "
                  << egptr() - gptr() << " read positions available.\n";

        pos_type rc = std::stringbuf::seekpos(sp, which);

        std::cout << "seekpos() returns " << rc << ".\nAfter the call, "
                  << "size of the get area is "
                  << egptr() - eback() << " with "
                  << egptr() - gptr() << " read positions available.\n";

        return rc;
    }
};

int main()
{
    mybuf buf("12345");
    std::iostream stream(&buf);
    stream.seekg(2);
}

   Output:
Before seekpos(2), size of the get area is 5 with 5 read positions available.
seekpos() returns 2.
After the call, size of the get area is 5 with 3 read positions available.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 375 C++98 static constant members of std::ios_base were
   misspecified as members of std::basic_ios corrected
   LWG 564 C++98 if was unclear how to reposition gptr and/or pptr they
   are repositioned by seekoff()
