   Defined in header <cstdio>
   std::size_t fread( void* buffer, std::size_t size, std::size_t count,
   std::FILE* stream );

   Reads up to count objects into the array buffer from the given input
   stream stream as if by calling std::fgetc size times for each object,
   and storing the results, in the order obtained, into the successive
   positions of buffer, which is reinterpreted as an array of unsigned
   char. The file position indicator for the stream is advanced by the
   number of characters read.

   If the objects are not TriviallyCopyable, the behavior is undefined.

   If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position indicator
   for the stream is indeterminate. If a partial element is read, its
   value is indeterminate.

Parameters

   buffer - pointer to the first object in the array to be read
   size   - size of each object in bytes
   count  - the number of the objects to be read
   stream - input file stream to read from

Return value

   Number of objects read successfully, which may be less than count if an
   error or end-of-file condition occurs.

   If size or count is zero, fread returns zero and performs no other
   action.

   fread does not distinguish between end-of-file and error, and callers
   must use std::feof and std::ferror to determine which occurred.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstddef>
#include <cstdio>
#include <fstream>
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    // Prepare file
    std::ofstream("test.txt") << 1 << ' ' << 2 << '\n';
    std::FILE* f = std::fopen("test.txt", "r");

    std::vector<char> buf(4); // char is trivially copyable
    const std::size_t n = std::fread(&buf[0], sizeof buf[0], buf.size(), f);

    std::cout << "Read " << n << " object" << (n > 1 ? "s" : "") << ": "
              << std::hex << std::uppercase << std::setfill('0');
    for (char n : buf)
        std::cout << "0x" << std::setw(2) << static_cast<short>(n) << ' ';
    std::cout << '\n';

    std::vector<std::string> buf2; // string is not trivially copyable
//  This would result in undefined behavior:
//  std::fread(&buf2[0], sizeof buf2[0], buf2.size(), f);
}

   Possible output:
Read 4 objects: 0x31 0x20 0x32 0x0A
