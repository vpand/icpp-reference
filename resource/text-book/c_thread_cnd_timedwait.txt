   Defined in header <threads.h>
   int cnd_timedwait( cnd_t* restrict cond, mtx_t* restrict mutex,
                      const struct timespec* restrict time_point );
                                                                  (since C11)

   Atomically unlocks the mutex pointed to by mutex and blocks on the
   condition variable pointed to by cond until the thread is signalled by
   cnd_signal or cnd_broadcast, or until the TIME_UTC based time point
   pointed to by time_point has been reached, or until a spurious wake-up
   occurs. The mutex is locked again before the function returns.

   The behavior is undefined if the mutex is not already locked by the
   calling thread.

Parameters

   cond       - pointer to the condition variable to block on
   mutex      - pointer to the mutex to unlock for the duration of the block
   time_point - pointer to an object specifying timeout time to wait until

Return value

   thrd_success if successful, thrd_timedout if the timeout time has been
   reached before the mutex is locked, or thrd_error if an error occurred.
