                                = std::ios_base::out );
  (4)                                                              (since C++11)

   explicit basic_ofstream( const FsPath& filename,
                            std::ios_base::openmode mode
                                = std::ios_base::out );
  (5)                                                              (since C++17)
  basic_ofstream( basic_ofstream&& other );
  (6)                                                              (since C++11)

   Constructs new file stream.
   1) Default constructor: constructs a stream that is not associated with
   a file: default-constructs the std::basic_filebuf and constructs the
   base with the pointer to this default-constructed std::basic_filebuf
   member.
   2,3) First, performs the same steps as the default constructor, then
   associates the stream with a file by calling rdbuf()->open(filename,
   mode | std::ios_base::out) (see std::basic_filebuf::open for the
   details on the effects of that call). If the open() call returns a null
   pointer, sets setstate(failbit). Overload (3) is only provided if
   std::filesystem::path::value_type is not char.(since C++17)
   4,5) Same as basic_ofstream(filename.c_str(), mode). (5) participates
   in overload resolution only if FsPath is std::filesystem::path.(since
   C++17) Note that despite the default mode being out, the effects are
   identical to the effects of out | trunc as described in
   std::filebuf::open
   6) Move constructor. First, move-constructs the base class from other
   (which does not affect the rdbuf() pointer), then move-constructs the
   std::basic_filebuf member, then calls this->set_rdbuf() to install the
   new basic_filebuf as the rdbuf() pointer in the base class.
   7) The copy-constructor is deleted: this class is not copyable.

Parameters

   filename - the name of the file to be opened
   mode - specifies stream open mode. Following constants and bit-wise OR
   between them may be used:
   Constant          Explanation
   app               seek to the end of stream before each write
   binary            open in binary mode
   in                open for reading
   out               open for writing
   trunc             discard the contents of the stream when opening
   ate               seek to the end of stream immediately after open
   noreplace (C++23) open in exclusive mode
   other - another file stream to use as source

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <utility>

int main()
{
    std::ofstream f0;
    std::ofstream f1("test.bin", std::ios::binary);
    std::string name = "example.txt";
    std::ofstream f2(name);
    std::ofstream f3(std::move(f1));
}

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 3430 C++17 std::filesystem::path overload led to unwanted
   conversions avoided by making it a template
