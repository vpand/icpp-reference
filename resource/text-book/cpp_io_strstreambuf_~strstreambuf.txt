   virtual ~strstreambuf();
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   Destroys a std::strstreambuf object. if the object is managing a
   dynamically-allocated buffer (the buffer state is "allocated") and if
   the object is not frozen, then deallocates the buffer using the
   deallocation function provided at construction or delete[] if none was
   provided.

Parameters

   (none)

Notes

   This destructor is typically called by the destructor of
   std::strstream.

   If str() was called on a dynamic strstream and freeze(false) was not
   called after that, this destructor leaks memory.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iostream>
#include <strstream>

void* my_alloc(size_t n)
{
    std::cout << "my_alloc(" << n << ") called\n";
    return new char[n];
}

void my_free(void* p)
{
    std::cout << "my_free() called\n";
    delete[] (char*)p;
}

int main()
{
    {
        std::strstreambuf buf(my_alloc, my_free);
        std::ostream s(&buf);
        s << 1.23 << std::ends;
        std::cout << buf.str() << '\n';
        buf.freeze(false);
    } // destructor called here, buffer deallocated

    {
        std::strstreambuf buf(my_alloc, my_free);
        std::ostream s(&buf);
        s << 1.23 << std::ends;
        std::cout << buf.str() << '\n';
//      buf.freeze(false);
    } // destructor called here, memory leak!
}

   Output:
my_alloc(4096) called
1.23
my_free() called
my_alloc(4096) called
1.23
