 (1)
 basic_iostream( const basic_iostream& other ) = delete;
 (2)                                                               (since C++11)
   protected:
   basic_iostream( basic_iostream&& other );
 (3)                                                               (since C++11)

   Constructs new stream object.
   1) Initializes with streambuf sb. The base classes are initialized as
   basic_istream<CharT,Traits>(sb) and basic_ostream<CharT,Traits>(sb).
   After the call rdbuf() == sb and gcount() == 0.
   2) Copy construction is not allowed.
   3) Move constructor: move-constructs the first base class basic_istream
   as basic_istream<CharT,Traits>(std::move(rhs));, which in turn
   move-constructs and initializes the virtual base std::basic_ios. The
   initialization of the other base, basic_ostream, is
   implementation-defined (e.g., a protected default constructor may be
   added to std::basic_ostream, which does nothing) because
   move-construction cannot use rhs twice. This move constructor is
   protected: it is called by the move constructors of the derived stream
   classes std::basic_fstream and std::basic_stringstream before they
   move-construct and associate the stream buffer.

Parameters

   sb    - streambuf to initialize with
   other - another stream to initialize with
