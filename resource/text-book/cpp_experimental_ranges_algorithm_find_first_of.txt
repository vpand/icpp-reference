   1) Searches the range [first1, last1) for any of the elements in the
   range [first2, last2), after projecting the ranges with proj1 and proj2
   respectively. The projected elements are compared using pred.
   2) Same as (1), but uses r1 as the first source range and r2 as the
   second source range, as if using ranges::begin(r1) as first1,
   ranges::end(r1) as last1, ranges::begin(r2) as first2, and
   ranges::end(r2) as last2.

Parameters

   first1, last1 - the range of elements to examine
   r1            - the range of elements to examine
   first2, last2 - the range of elements to search for
   r2            - the range of elements to search for
   pred          - predicate to use to compare the projected elements with
   proj1         - projection to apply to the elements in the first range
   proj2         - projection to apply to the elements in the second range

Return value

   Iterator to the first element in the range [first1, last1) that is
   equal to an element from the range [first2, last2) after projection. If
   no such element is found, an iterator comparing equal to last1 is
   returned.

Complexity

   At most (S * N) applications of the predicate and each projection,
   where S = distance(last2 - first2) and N = last1 - first1.

Possible implementation

template<InputIterator I1, Sentinel<I1> S1, ForwardIterator I2, Sentinel<I2> S2,
         class Proj1 = ranges::identity, class Proj2 = ranges::identity,
         IndirectRelation<projected<I1, Proj1>,
                          projected<I2, Proj2>> Pred = ranges::equal_to<>>
I1 find_first_of(I1 first1, S1 last1, I2 first2, S2 last2, Pred pred = Pred{},
                 Proj1 proj1 = Proj1{}, Proj2 proj2 = Proj2{})
{
    for (; first1 != last1; ++first1)
        for (ForwardIt it = first2; it != last2; ++it)
            if (ranges::invoke(pred, ranges::invoke(proj1, *first1),
                                     ranges::invoke(proj2, *it)))
                return first1;
    return first1;
