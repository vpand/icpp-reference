   Assigns the contents.
   1) Copy assignment operator. Assigns the contents of other. Equivalent
   to assign(other);.
   2) Move assignment operator. Assigns the contents of other using move
   semantics. other is in valid, but unspecified state after the
   operation. Equivalent to assign(other);.
   3) Assigns a null-terminated character string pointed to by ptr.
   Equivalent to assign(ptr);.
   4) Assigns characters contained in initializer list il. Equivalent to
   assign(il);.
   5) Assigns the contents of the string p. Equivalent to assign(p);.

Parameters

   other - another regex object
   ptr   - pointer to a null-terminated character string
   il    - initializer list containing characters to assign
   p     - string containing characters to assign

Return value

   *this

Exceptions

   1) May throw implementation-defined exceptions.
   3-5) std::regex_error if the supplied regular expression is not valid.
   The object is not modified in that case.
