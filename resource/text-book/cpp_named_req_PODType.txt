   Specifies that the type is POD (Plain Old Data) type. This means the
   type is compatible with the types used in the C programming language,
   that is, can be exchanged with C libraries directly, in its binary
   form.

   Note: the standard doesn't define a named requirement with this name.
   This is a type category defined by the core language. It is included
   here as a named requirement only for consistency.

   This type requirement is deprecated in the C++ standard. All of its
   uses have been replaced by the more refined type requirements, such as
   TrivialType, ScalarType, or StandardLayoutType.
   (since C++20)

Requirements

   The following types are collectively called POD types:
     * scalar types
     * POD classes
     * arrays of such types
     * cv-qualified versions of these types
