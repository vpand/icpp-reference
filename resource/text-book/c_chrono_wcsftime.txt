   size_t wcsftime( wchar_t* str, size_t count, const wchar_t* format,
   const struct tm* time );
                                                                     (since C95)

   Converts the date and time information from a given calendar time time
   to a null-terminated wide character string str according to format
   string format. Up to count bytes are written.

Parameters

   str - pointer to the first element of the wchar_t array for output
   count - maximum number of wide characters to write
   format - pointer to a null-terminated wide character string specifying
   the format of conversion

Format string

   The format string consists of zero or more conversion specifiers and
   ordinary characters (except %). All ordinary characters, including the
   terminating null character, are copied to the output string without
   modification. Each conversion specification begins with % character,
   optionally followed by E or O modifier (ignored if unsupported by the
   locale), followed by the character that determines the behavior of the
   specifier. The following format specifiers are available:
   Conversion

   % writes literal %. The full conversion specification must be %%.

Example

   Run this code
#include <locale.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <wchar.h>

int main(void)
{
    wchar_t buff[40];
    struct tm my_time =
    {
        .tm_year = 112, // = year 2012
        .tm_mon = 9,    // = 10th month
        .tm_mday = 9,   // = 9th day
        .tm_hour = 8,   // = 8 hours
        .tm_min = 10,   // = 10 minutes
        .tm_sec = 20    // = 20 secs
    };

    if (wcsftime(buff, sizeof buff, L"%A %c", &my_time))
        printf("%ls\n", buff);
    else
        puts("wcsftime failed");

    setlocale(LC_ALL, "ja_JP.utf8");

    if (wcsftime(buff, sizeof buff, L"%A %c", &my_time))
        printf("%ls\n", buff);
    else
        puts("wcsftime failed");
