   Defined in header <stdlib.h>
   void abort_handler_s( const char * restrict msg,

                         void * restrict ptr,
                         errno_t error
                       );
                                                   (since C11)

   Writes an implementation-defined message to stderr which must include
   the string pointed to by msg and calls abort().

   A pointer to this function can be passed to set_constraint_handler_s to
   establish a runtime constraints violation handler.

          As with all bounds-checked functions, abort_handler_s is only
          guaranteed to be available if __STDC_LIB_EXT1__ is defined by
          the implementation and if the user defines
          __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ to the integer constant 1 before
          including <stdlib.h>.

Parameters

   msg - pointer to the message written to the standard error stream
   ptr - pointer to an implementation-defined object or a null pointer.
   Examples of implementation-defined objects are objects that give the
   name of the function that detected the violation and the line number
   when the violation was detected
   error - a positive value of type errno_t

Return value

   none; this function does not return to its caller

Notes

   If set_constraint_handler_s is never called, the default handler is
   implementation-defined: it may be abort_handler_s, ignore_handler_s, or
   some other implementation-defined handler.

Example

   Run this code
#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT1__ 1
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
#ifdef __STDC_LIB_EXT1__
    char dst[2];
    set_constraint_handler_s(ignore_handler_s);
    int r = strcpy_s(dst, sizeof dst, "Too long!");
    printf("dst = \"%s\", r = %d\n", dst, r);
    set_constraint_handler_s(abort_handler_s);
    r = strcpy_s(dst, sizeof dst, "Too long!");
    printf("dst = \"%s\", r = %d\n", dst, r);
#endif
}

   Possible output:
dst = "", r = 22
abort_handler_s was called in response to a runtime-constraint violation.

The runtime-constraint violation was caused by the following expression in strcp
y_s:
(s1max <= (s2_len=strnlen_s(s2, s1max)) ) (in string_s.c:62)

Note to end users: This program was terminated as a result
of a bug present in the software. Please reach out to your
software's vendor to get more help.
