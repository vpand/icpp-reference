   1) Computes the inclusive prefix sum using op.
   For each integer i in [0, std::distance(first, last)), performs the
   following operations in order:
    1. Creates a sequence which is formed by the values transformed from
       the elements of [first, iter] in order by unary_op, where iter is
       the next i
       th iterator of first.
    2. Computes the generalized noncommutative sum of the sequence over
       binary_op.
    3. Assigns the result to *dest, where dest is the next i
       th iterator of d_first.

   3) Same as (1), but each sequence created is formed by init followed by
   the elements of [first, iter] in order.
   2,4) Same as (1,3), but executed according to policy.
   These overloads participate in overload resolution only if

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::decay_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is true.
   (until C++20)

   std::is_execution_policy_v<std::remove_cvref_t<ExecutionPolicy>> is
   true.
   (since C++20)

   The generalized noncommutative sum of a sequence of elements over a
   binary operation binary_op is defined as follows:
     * If the sequence only has one element, the sum is the value of the
       element.
     * Otherwise, performs the following operations in order:

    1. Selects any two adjacent elements elem1 and elem2 from the
       sequence.
    2. Calculates binary_op(elem1, elem2) and replaces the two elements in
       the sequence with the result.
    3. Repeats steps 1 and 2 until there is only one element in the
       sequence.

   The result is non-deterministic if the binary_op is not associative
   (such as floating-point addition).

   For overloads (1,2), if binary_op(unary_op(*first), unary_op(*first))
   is not convertible to the value type of decltype(first), the program is
   ill-formed.

   For overloads (3,4), if any of the following values is not convertible
   to T, the program is ill-formed:
     * binary_op(init, init)
     * binary_op(init, unary_op(*first))
     * binary_op(unary_op(*first), unary_op(*first))

   If any of the following conditions is satisfied, the behavior is
   undefined:
     * For overloads (1,2), the value type of decltype(first) is not
       MoveConstructible.
     * For overloads (3,4), T is not MoveConstructible.
     * unary_op or binary_op modifies any element of [first, last).
     * unary_op or binary_op invalidates any iterator or subrange of
       [first, last].

Parameters

   first, last - the range of elements to sum
   d_first - the beginning of the destination range; may be equal to first
   policy - the execution policy to use. See execution policy for details.
   init - the initial value
   unary_op - unary FunctionObject that will be applied to each element of
   the input range. The return type must be acceptable as input to
   binary_op.
   binary_op - binary FunctionObject that will be applied in to the result
   of unary_op, the results of other binary_op, and init if provided
   Type requirements
   -
   InputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyInputIterator.
   -
   OutputIt must meet the requirements of LegacyOutputIterator.
   -
   ForwardIt1, ForwardIt2 must meet the requirements of
   LegacyForwardIterator.

Return value

   Iterator to the element past the last element written.

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as std::distance(first, last):
   1-4) \(\scriptsize O(N)\)O(N) applications of unary_op and binary_op
   respectively.

Exceptions

   The overloads with a template parameter named ExecutionPolicy report
   errors as follows:
     * If execution of a function invoked as part of the algorithm throws
       an exception and ExecutionPolicy is one of the standard policies,
       std::terminate is called. For any other ExecutionPolicy, the
       behavior is implementation-defined.
     * If the algorithm fails to allocate memory, std::bad_alloc is
       thrown.

Notes

   unary_op is never applied to init.

   The parameter init appears last, differing from
   std::transform_exclusive_scan, because it is optional for this
   function.

Example

   Run this code
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <iterator>
#include <numeric>
#include <vector>

int main()
{
    std::vector data{3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6};

    auto times_10 = [](int x) { return x * 10; };

    std::cout << "10 times exclusive sum: ";
    std::transform_exclusive_scan(data.begin(), data.end(),
                                  std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "),
                                  0, std::plus<int>{}, times_10);
    std::cout << "\n10 times inclusive sum: ";
    std::transform_inclusive_scan(data.begin(), data.end(),
                                  std::ostream_iterator<int>(std::cout, " "),
                                  std::plus<int>{}, times_10);
    std::cout << '\n';
}

   Output:
10 times exclusive sum: 0 30 40 80 90 140 230 250
10 times inclusive sum: 30 40 80 90 140 230 250 310
