   protected:
   virtual int_type pbackfail( int_type c = Traits::eof() )

   This protected virtual function is called by the public functions
   basic_streambuf::sungetc and basic_streambuf::sputbackc (which, in
   turn, are called by basic_istream::unget and basic_istream::putback).
   1) The caller is requesting that the get area is backed up by one
   character (pbackfail() is called with no arguments), in which case,
   this function re-reads the file starting one byte earlier and
   decrements basic_streambuf::gptr(), e.g. by calling gbump(-1).
   2) The caller attempts to putback a different character from the one
   retrieved earlier (pbackfail() is called with the character that needs
   to be put back), in which case
   a) First, checks if there is a putback position, and if there isn't,
   backs up the get area by re-reading the file starting one byte earlier.
   a) Then checks what character is in the putback position. If the
   character held there is already equal to c, as determined by
   Traits::eq(to_char_type(c), gptr()[-1]), then simply decrements
   basic_streambuf::gptr().
   b) Otherwise, if the buffer is allowed to modify its own get area,
   decrements basic_streambuf::gptr() and writes c to the location pointed
   to gptr() after adjustment.

   This function never modifies the file, only the get area of the
   in-memory buffer.

   If the file is not open (is_open()==false, this function returns
   Traits::eof() immediately.

Parameters

   c - the character to put back, or Traits::eof() to indicate that
   backing up of the get area is requested

Return value

   c on success except if c was Traits::eof(), in which case
   Traits::not_eof(c) is returned.

   Traits::eof() on failure.
