   std::ranges
   std::ranges::views
   (C++20)

   This page tries to list all the symbols that are available from the
   standard library (ranges library) in the namespace std::ranges. The
   symbols are written as follows:
     * Function names with ().
     * Templates with <>.

   Symbols from std::ranges's sub-namespaces (e.g. views) are not listed
   here, but the namespace names (prepended with the icon |>) are the
   links to the corresponding pages.
