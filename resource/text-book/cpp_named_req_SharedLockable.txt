   The SharedLockable requirements describe the minimal characteristics of
   types that provide shared blocking semantics for execution agents (i.e.
   threads).

Requirements

   For type L to be SharedLockable, the following conditions have to be
   satisfied for an object m of type L:
   Expression Preconditions Effects Return value
   m.lock_shared() Blocks until a lock can be obtained for the current
   execution agent (thread, process, task). If an exception is thrown, no
   lock is obtained.
   m.try_lock_shared() Attempts to obtain a lock for the current execution
   agent (thread, process, task) without blocking. If an exception is
   thrown, no lock is obtained. true if the lock was obtained, false
   otherwise
   m.unlock_shared() The current execution agent holds a shared lock on m.
   Releases the shared lock held by the execution agent.

   Throws no exceptions.

Shared locks

   A lock on an object is said to be shared lock if it is acquired by a
   call to lock_shared, try_lock_shared, try_lock_shared_for, or
   try_lock_shared_until member function.
