   typedef void ( *event_callback )( event type, ios_base& ios, int index
   );

   The type of function callbacks that can be registered using
   register_callback() to be called on specific events.

   type is a value of type ios_base::event which indicates the type of the
   event that will invoke this callback.

   ios refers to the stream object for which the callback is invoked:
   *this is passed as the argument when callbacks are invoked by
   std::ios_base and std::basic_ios member functions.

   index is the user-provided value passed to register_callback() when
   registering the function.
