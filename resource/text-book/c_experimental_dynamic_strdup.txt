   Defined in header <string.h>
   char * strdup( const char *str1 );
                                     (dynamic memory TR)

   Returns a pointer to a null-terminated byte string, which is a
   duplicate of the string pointed to by str1. The returned pointer must
   be passed to free to avoid a memory leak.

   If an error occurs, a null pointer is returned and errno may be set.

   As all functions from Dynamic Memory TR, strdup is only guaranteed to
   be available if __STDC_ALLOC_LIB__ is defined by the implementation and
   if the user defines __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__ to the integer constant 1
   before including string.h.

Parameters

   str1 - pointer to the null-terminated byte string to duplicate

Return value

   A pointer to the newly allocated string, or a null pointer if an error
   occurred.

Notes

   The function is identical to the POSIX strdup.

Example

   Run this code
#ifdef __STDC_ALLOC_LIB__
#define __STDC_WANT_LIB_EXT2__ 1
#else
#define _POSIX_C_SOURCE 200809L
#endif

#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main(void)
{
    const char *s1 = "String";
    char *s2 = strdup(s1);
    assert(strcmp(s1, s2) == 0);
    free(s2);
}
