   strstreambuf* rdbuf() const;
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   Returns a pointer to the associated std::strstreambuf, casting away its
   constness (despite the const qualifier on the member function).

Parameters

   (none)

Return value

   Pointer to the associated std::strstreambuf, with constness cast away.

Example

   Run this code
#include <strstream>

int main()
{
    const std::strstream buf;
    std::strstreambuf* ptr = buf.rdbuf();
}
