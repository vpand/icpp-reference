   Defined in header <experimental/memory_resource>
   struct pool_options {

       std::size_t largest_required_pool_block = 0;

   The struct std::experimental::pmr::pool_options contains a set of
   constructor options for
   std::experimental::pmr::synchronized_pool_resource and
   std::experimental::pmr::unsynchronized_pool_resource.

Data members

   std::size_t max_blocks_per_chunk
   the maximum number of blocks that will be allocated at once from the
   upstream memory resource to replenish a pool
   (public member object)
   std::size_t largest_required_pool_block
   the largest allocation size that is required to be fulfilled through
   the pooling mechanism
   (public member object)

   If the value of max_blocks_per_chunk is zero or greater than an
   implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The
   implementation may use a smaller value than is specified and may use
   different values for different pools.

   If the value of largest_required_pool_block is zero or greater than an
   implementation-defined limit, that limit is used instead. The
   implementation may use a threshold greater than specified in this
   field.
