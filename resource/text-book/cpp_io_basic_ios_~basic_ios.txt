   virtual ~basic_ios();

   Destroys the basic_ios object. rdbuf is not destroyed.

Notes

   This destructor is virtual because the base class destructor,
   ios_base::~ios_base is virtual.

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 53 C++98 it was unspecified whether rdbuf is destroyed it is not
   destroyed
