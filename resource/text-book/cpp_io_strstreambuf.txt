   Defined in header <strstream>
   class strstreambuf : public std::basic_streambuf<char>
   (deprecated in C++98)
   (removed in C++26)

   std::strstreambuf is a std::basic_streambuf whose associated character
   sequence is a character array, which may be constant (e.g. a string
   literal), modifiable but not dynamic (e.g. a stack-allocated array), or
   dynamic, in which case the std::strstreambuf may be allowed to
   reallocate the array as necessary to accommodate output (e.g. by
   calling delete[] and new[] or user-provided functions).

   Typical implementation of a std::strstreambuf holds four private data
   members:
   1) buffer state, a bitmask type which can represent any combination of
   the four values "allocated" (destructor will deallocate), "constant"
   (output not allowed), "dynamic" (output may reallocate), or "frozen"
   (deallocation and reallocation are not allowed)
   2) allocated buffer size (the beginning of the buffer does not need a
   special data member, it may be stored in the inherited pointer eback())
   3) pointer to user-provided allocation function
   4) pointer to user-provided deallocation function.

Notes

   After any call to str() on a stream with a dynamic buffer, a call to
   freeze(false) is required to allow the strstreambuf destructor to
   deallocate the buffer when necessary.

   strstreambuf has been deprecated since C++98 and removed since C++26.
   The recommended replacement is std::spanbuf(since C++23).

Member functions

Public member functions

   array
   (virtual public member function)
   freeze
   sets/clears the frozen state of the buffer
   (public member function)
   str
   marks the buffer frozen and returns the beginning pointer of the input
   sequence
   (public member function)
   pcount
   returns the next pointer minus the beginning pointer in the output
   sequence: the number of characters written
   (public member function)

   pointer
   (virtual protected member function)

   [virtual]
   backs out the input sequence to unget a character
   (virtual protected member function)
   overflow
   [virtual]

   allocate the buffer if dynamic and not frozen
   (virtual protected member function)
   setbuf
   [virtual]
   attempts to replace the controlled character sequence with an array
   (virtual protected member function)
   seekoff
   [virtual]
   repositions the next pointer in the input sequence, output sequence, or
   both, using relative addressing
   (virtual protected member function)
   seekpos
   [virtual]
   repositions the next pointer in the input sequence, output sequence, or
   both using absolute addressing
   (virtual protected member function)
