   Defined in header <istream>
   template< class CharT, class Traits >
   std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>& ws( std::basic_istream<CharT,
   Traits>& is );

   Discards leading whitespace from an input stream.

   Behaves as an UnformattedInputFunction, except that is.gcount() is not
   modified. After constructing and checking the sentry object, extracts
   characters from the stream and discards them until any one of the
   following conditions occurs:
     * end of file condition occurs in the input sequence (in which case
       the function calls setstate(eofbit) but does not set failbit; this
       does not apply if the eofbit is already set on is prior to the call
       to ws, in which case the construction of the sentry object would
       set failbit).

     * the next available character c in the input sequence is not
       whitespace as determined by std::isspace(c, is.getloc()). The
       non-whitespace character is not extracted.

   This is an input-only I/O manipulator, it may be called with an
   expression such as in >> std::ws for any in of type std::basic_istream.

Parameters

   is - reference to input stream

Return value

   is (reference to the stream after extraction of consecutive
   whitespace).

Notes

   If eofbit is set on the stream prior to the call, the construction of
   the sentry object will set failbit.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <istream>
#include <sstream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    for (const char* str : {"     #1 test", "\t #2 test", "#3 test"})
    {
        std::string line;
        std::getline(std::istringstream{str}, line);
        std::cout << "getline returns:\t" << std::quoted(line) << '\n';

        std::istringstream iss{str};
        std::getline(iss >> std::ws, line);
        std::cout << "ws + getline returns:\t" << std::quoted(line) << '\n';
    }
}

   Output:
getline returns:        "     #1 test"
ws + getline returns:   "#1 test"
getline returns:        "        #2 test"
ws + getline returns:   "#2 test"
getline returns:        "#3 test"
ws + getline returns:   "#3 test"

Defect reports

   The following behavior-changing defect reports were applied
   retroactively to previously published C++ standards.
   DR Applied to Behavior as published Correct behavior
   LWG 415 C++98 calling std::ws might not construct the sentry
   object (insonsistent with other input functions) required to construct
   the sentry object
