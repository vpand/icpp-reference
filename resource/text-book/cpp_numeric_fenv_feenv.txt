   Defined in header <cfenv>
   int fegetenv( std::fenv_t* envp )
   (1)                                     (since C++11)
   int fesetenv( const std::fenv_t* envp );
   (2)                                     (since C++11)

   Manages the status of the floating-point environment.
   1) Attempts to store the status of the floating-point environment in
   the object pointed to by envp.
   2) Attempts to establish the floating-point environment from the object
   pointed to by envp. The value of that object must be previously
   obtained by a call to std::feholdexcept or std::fegetenv or be a
   floating-point macro constant. If any of the floating-point status
   flags are set in envp, they become set in the environment (and are then
   testable with std::fetestexcept), but the corresponding floating-point
   exceptions are not raised (execution continues uninterrupted)

Parameters

   envp - pointer to the object of type std::fenv_t which holds the status
   of the floating-point environment

Return value

   0 on success, non-zero otherwise.
