   Defined in header <stdatomic.h>
   A kill_dependency( A y );
                                  (since C11)

   Informs the compiler that the dependency tree started by an
   memory_order_consume atomic load operation does not extend past the
   return value of kill_dependency; that is, the argument does not carry a
   dependency into the return value.

   The function is implemented as a macro. A is the type of y.

Parameters

   y - the expression whose return value is to be removed from a
   dependency tree

Return value

   Returns y, no longer a part of a dependency tree.
