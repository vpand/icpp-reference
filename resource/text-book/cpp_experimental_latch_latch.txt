   explicit latch( ptrdiff_t value );
   (1)                               (concurrency TS)
   latch( const latch & ) = delete;
   (2)                               (concurrency TS)
   1) Constructs a latch and initializes its internal counter.
   2) Copy constructor is deleted. latch is not copyable.

Parameters

   value - the initial value of the internal counter; must be non-negative
