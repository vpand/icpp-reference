   Defined in header <cstdio>
   int puts( const char *str );

   Writes every character from the null-terminated string str and one
   additional newline character '\n' to the output stream stdout, as if by
   repeatedly executing std::fputc.

   The terminating null character from str is not written.

Parameters

   str - character string to be written

Return value

   On success, returns a non-negative value

   On failure, returns EOF and sets the error indicator (see std::ferror)
   on stdout.

Notes

   The std::puts function appends the newline character to the output,
   while std::fputs function does not.

   Different implementations return different non-negative numbers: some
   return the last character written, some return the number of characters
   written (or INT_MAX if the string was longer than that), some simply
   return a non-negative constant.

   A typical cause of failure for std::puts is running out of space on the
   file system, when stdout is redirected to a file.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdio>

int main()
{
    int rc = std::puts("Hello World");

    if (rc == EOF)
        std::perror("puts()"); // POSIX requires that errno is set
}

   Output:
Hello World
