   Defined in header <locale>
   public:
   string_type transform( const CharT* low, const CharT* high ) const;
   (1)
   protected:
   virtual string_type do_transform( const CharT* low, const CharT* high )
   const;
   (2)
   1) Public member function, calls the protected virtual member function
   do_transform of the most derived class.
   2) Converts the character sequence [low, high) to a string that,
   compared lexicographically (e.g. with operator< for strings) with the
   result of calling transform() on another string, produces the same
   result as calling do_compare() on the same two strings.

Parameters

   low  - pointer to the first character in the sequence to transform
   high - one past the end pointer for the sequence to transform

Return value

   The string transformed so that lexicographic comparison of the
   transformed strings may be used instead of collating of the originals.
   In the "C" locale, the returned string is the exact copy of
   [low, high). In other locales, the contents of the returned string are
   implementation-defined, and the size may be considerably longer.

Notes

   In addition to the use in collation, the implementation-specific format
   of the transformed string is known to
   std::regex_traits<>::transform_primary, which is able to extract the
   equivalence class information.

Example

   Run this code
#include <iomanip>
#include <iostream>
#include <locale>

int main()
{
    std::locale::global(std::locale("sv_SE.utf8"));
    auto& f = std::use_facet<std::collate<wchar_t>>(std::locale());

    std::wstring in1 = L"\u00e4ngel";
    std::wstring in2 = L"\u00e5r";

    std::wstring out1 = f.transform(&in1[0], &in1[0] + in1.size());
    std::wstring out2 = f.transform(&in2[0], &in2[0] + in2.size());

    std::wcout << "In the Swedish locale: ";
    if (out1 < out2)
        std::wcout << in1 << " before " << in2 << '\n';
    else
        std::wcout << in2 << " before " << in1 << '\n';

    std::wcout << "In lexicographic comparison: ";
    if (in1 < in2)
        std::wcout << in1 << " before " << in2 << '\n';
    else
        std::wcout << in2 << " before " << in1 << '\n';
}

   Output:
In the Swedish locale: år before ängel
In lexicographic comparison: ängel before år
