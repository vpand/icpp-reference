   static char_type*
       copy( char_type* dest, const char_type* src, std::size_t count );
                    (constexpr since C++20)

   Copies count characters from the character string pointed to by src to
   the character string pointed to by dest.

   If [dest, dest + count) and [src, src + count) overlap, the behavior is
   undefined.

   See CharTraits for the general requirements on character traits for
   X::copy.

Parameters

   dest  - pointer to a character string to copy to
   src   - pointer to a character string to copy from
   count - the number of characters to copy

Return value

   dest

Exceptions

   Throws nothing.

Complexity

   Linear in count.
