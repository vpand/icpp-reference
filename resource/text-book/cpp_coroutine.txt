   The coroutine support library defines several types that provide
   compile and run-time support for coroutines.

Coroutine traits

   Defined in header <coroutine>
   coroutine_traits
   (C++20)
   trait type for discovering coroutine promise types
   (class template)

Coroutine handle

   Defined in header <coroutine>
   coroutine_handle
   (C++20)
   used to refer to a suspended or executing coroutine
   (class template)

No-op coroutines

   Defined in header <coroutine>
   noop_coroutine
   (C++20)
   creates a coroutine handle that has no observable effects when resumed
   or destroyed
   (function)
   noop_coroutine_promise
   (C++20)
   used for coroutines with no observable effects
   (class)
   noop_coroutine_handle
   (C++20)
   std::coroutine_handle<std::noop_coroutine_promise>, intended to refer
   to a no-op coroutine
   (typedef)

Trivial awaitables

   Defined in header <coroutine>
   suspend_never
   (C++20)
   indicates that an await-expression should never suspend
   (class)
   suspend_always
   (C++20)
   indicates that an await-expression should always suspend
   (class)
