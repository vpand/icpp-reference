   Defined in header <experimental/latch>
   class latch;
                                         (concurrency TS)

   The latch class is a downward counter of type ptrdiff_t which can be
   used to synchronize threads. The value of the counter is initialized on
   creation. Threads may block on the latch until the counter is
   decremented to zero. There is no possibility to increase or reset the
   counter, which makes the latch a single-use barrier.

   Unlike std::experimental::barrier, std::experimental::latch can be
   decremented by a participating thread more than once.
