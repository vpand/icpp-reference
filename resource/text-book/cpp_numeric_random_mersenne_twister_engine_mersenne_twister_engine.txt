   mersenne_twister_engine() : mersenne_twister_engine(default_seed) {}
   (1) (since C++11)

   (4) (since C++11)
   (implicitly declared)

   Constructs the pseudo-random number engine.
   1) The default constructor.
   2) Constructs the engine with a seed value value. Given \(2^w\)2w
   as p, the engine's initial state is determined as follows:
    1. Sets \(X_{-n}\)X
       -n to value % p.
    2. For each integer i in [i - n, -1], sets \(X_i\)X
       i to \([f \cdot (X_{i-1}\ \mathsf{xor}\ (X_{i-1}\ \mathsf{rshift}\
       (w-2)))+i\mod n]\mod p\)[f·(X
       i-1 xor (X
       i-1 rshift (w-2)))+i mod n] mod p, where \(\mathsf{xor}\)xor and
       \(\mathsf{rshift}\)rshift stand for built-in bitwise XOR and
       bitwise right-shift respectively.

   3) Constructs the engine with a seed sequence seq. Given std::size_t(w
   / 32) + 1 as k, the engine's initial state is determined as follows:
    1. Creates an invented array object a of length n * k.
    2. Calls seq.generate(a + 0, a + n * k).
    3. For each integer i in [-n, -1], sets \(X_{i}\)X
       i to \((\sum^{k-1}_{j=0} a_{k(i+n)+j} \cdot 2^{32j}) \mod
       2^w\)(\sumk-1
       j=0 a
       k(i+n)+j·232j
       ) mod 2w
       .
    4. If the most significant w - r bits of \(X_{-n}\)X
       -n are zero, and if each of the other resulting \(X_{i}\)X
       i is 0, changes \(X_{-n}\)X
       -n to \(2^{w-1}\)2w-1
       .

   This overload participates in overload resolution only if SeedSeq meets
   the requirements of SeedSequence.
   4) The copy constructor. Upon construction, *this == other is true.

Parameters

   value - seed value to use in the initialization of the internal state
   seq   - seed sequence to use in the initialization of the internal state

Complexity

   1,2) \(\small{O(n)}\)O(n).
   3) Same as the complexity of the seq.generate call.
   4) \(\small{O(n)}\)O(n).
