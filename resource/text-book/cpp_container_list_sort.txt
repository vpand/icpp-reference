   void sort();
   (1)
   template< class Compare >
   void sort( Compare comp );
   (2)

   Sorts the elements and preserves the order of equivalent elements. No
   references or iterators become invalidated.
   1) Elements are compared using operator<.
   2) Elements are compared using comp.

   If an exception is thrown, the order of elements in *this is
   unspecified.

Parameters

   comp - comparison function object (i.e. an object that satisfies the
   requirements of Compare) which returns true if the first argument is
   less than (i.e. is ordered before) the second.

   The signature of the comparison function should be equivalent to the
   following:

   bool cmp(const Type1& a, const Type2& b);

   While the signature does not need to have const&, the function must not
   modify the objects passed to it and must be able to accept all values
   of type (possibly const) Type1 and Type2 regardless of value category
   (thus, Type1& is not allowed, nor is Type1 unless for Type1 a move is
   equivalent to a copy(since C++11)).
   The types Type1 and Type2 must be such that an object of type
   list<T,Allocator>::const_iterator can be dereferenced and then
   implicitly converted to both of them.
   Type requirements
   -
   Compare must meet the requirements of Compare.

Return value

   (none)

Complexity

   Given \(\scriptsize N\)N as size():
   1) Approximately \(\scriptsize N \cdot log(N)\)N·log(N) comparisons
   using operator<.
   2) Approximately \(\scriptsize N \cdot log(N)\)N·log(N) applications of
   the comparison function comp.

Notes

   std::sort requires random access iterators and so cannot be used with
   list. This function also differs from std::sort in that it does not
   require the element type of the list to be swappable, preserves the
   values of all iterators, and performs a stable sort.

Example

   Run this code
#include <functional>
#include <iostream>
#include <list>

std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& ostr, const std::list<int>& list)
{
    for (const int i : list)
        ostr << ' ' << i;
    return ostr;
}

int main()
{
    std::list<int> list{8, 7, 5, 9, 0, 1, 3, 2, 6, 4};
    std::cout << "initially: " << list << '\n';

    list.sort();
    std::cout << "ascending: " << list << '\n';

    list.sort(std::greater<int>());
    std::cout << "descending:" << list << '\n';
}

   Output:
initially:  8 7 5 9 0 1 3 2 6 4
ascending:  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
descending: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
