   Defined in header <cstring>
   void* memcpy( void* dest, const void* src, std::size_t count );

   Copies count bytes from the object pointed to by src to the object
   pointed to by dest. Both objects are reinterpreted as arrays of
   unsigned char.

   If the objects overlap, the behavior is undefined.

   If either dest or src is an invalid or null pointer, the behavior is
   undefined, even if count is zero.

   If the objects are potentially-overlapping or not TriviallyCopyable,
   the behavior of memcpy is not specified and may be undefined.

Parameters

   dest  - pointer to the memory location to copy to
   src   - pointer to the memory location to copy from
   count - number of bytes to copy

Return value

   dest

Notes

   std::memcpy may be used to implicitly create objects in the destination
   buffer.

   std::memcpy is meant to be the fastest library routine for
   memory-to-memory copy. It is usually more efficient than std::strcpy,
   which must scan the data it copies or std::memmove, which must take
   precautions to handle overlapping inputs.

   Several C++ compilers transform suitable memory-copying loops to
   std::memcpy calls.

   Where strict aliasing prohibits examining the same memory as values of
   two different types, std::memcpy may be used to convert the values.

Example

   Run this code
#include <cstdint>
#include <cstring>
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    // simple usage
    char source[] = "once upon a daydream...", dest[4];
    std::memcpy(dest, source, sizeof dest);
    std::cout << "dest[4] = {";
    for (int n{}; char c : dest)
        std::cout << (n++ ? ", " : "") << '\'' << c << "'";
    std::cout << "};\n";

    // reinterpreting
    double d = 0.1;
//  std::int64_t n = *reinterpret_cast<std::int64_t*>(&d); // aliasing violation
    std::int64_t n;
    std::memcpy(&n, &d, sizeof d); // OK

    std::cout << std::hexfloat << d << " is " << std::hex << n
              << " as a std::int64_t\n" << std::dec;

    // object creation in destination buffer
    struct S
    {
        int x{42};
        void print() const { std::cout << '{' << x << "}\n"; }
    } s;
    alignas(S) char buf[sizeof(S)];
    S* ps = new (buf) S; // placement new
    std::memcpy(ps, &s, sizeof s);
    ps->print();
}

   Output:
dest[4] = {'o', 'n', 'c', 'e'};
0x1.999999999999ap-4 is 3fb999999999999a as a std::int64_t
{42}
