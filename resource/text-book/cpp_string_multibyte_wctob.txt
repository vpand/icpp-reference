   Defined in header <cwchar>
   int wctob( std::wint_t c );

   Narrows a wide character c if its multibyte character equivalent in the
   initial shift state is a single byte.

   This is typically possible for the characters from the ASCII character
   set, since most multibyte encodings (such as UTF-8) use single bytes to
   encode those characters.

Parameters

   c - wide character to narrow

Return value

   EOF if c does not represent a multibyte character with length 1 in
   initial shift state.

   Otherwise, the single-byte representation of c as unsigned char
   converted to int.

Example

   Run this code
#include <clocale>
#include <cwchar>
#include <iostream>

void try_narrowing(wchar_t c)
{
    int cn = std::wctob(c);
    if (cn != EOF)
        std::cout << '\'' << int(c) << "' narrowed to " << +cn << '\n';
    else
        std::cout << '\'' << int(c) << "' could not be narrowed\n";
}

int main()
{
    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "th_TH.utf8");
    std::cout << std::hex << std::showbase << "In Thai UTF-8 locale:\n";
    try_narrowing(L'a');
    try_narrowing(L'');

    std::setlocale(LC_ALL, "th_TH.tis620");
    std::cout << "In Thai TIS-620 locale:\n";
    try_narrowing(L'a');
    try_narrowing(L'');
}

   Output:
In Thai UTF-8 locale:
'0x61' narrowed to 0x61
'0xe5b' could not be narrowed
In Thai TIS-620 locale:
'0x61' narrowed to 0x61
'0xe5b' narrowed to 0xfb
