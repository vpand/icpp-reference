   Defined in header <fstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>
   > class basic_ifstream : public std::basic_istream<CharT, Traits>

   The class template basic_ifstream implements high-level input
   operations on file-based streams. It interfaces a file-based
   streambuffer (std::basic_filebuf) with the high-level interface of
   (std::basic_istream).

   A typical implementation of std::basic_ifstream holds only one
   non-derived data member: an instance of std::basic_filebuf<CharT,
   Traits>.

Example

   Run this code
#include <fstream>
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

int main()
{
    std::string filename = "Test.b";

    // prepare a file to read
    double d = 3.14;
    std::ofstream(filename, std::ios::binary)
        .write(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&d), sizeof d) << 123 << "abc";

    // open file for reading
    std::ifstream istrm(filename, std::ios::binary);
    if (!istrm.is_open())
        std::cout << "failed to open " << filename << '\n';
    else
    {
        double d;
        istrm.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&d), sizeof d); // binary input
        int n;
        std::string s;
        if (istrm >> n >> s)                               // text input
            std::cout << "read back from file: " << d << ' ' << n << ' ' << s <<
 '\n';
    }
}

   Output:
read back from file: 3.14 123 abc
