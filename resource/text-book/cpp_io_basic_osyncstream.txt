   Defined in header <syncstream>
   template<

       class CharT,
       class Traits = std::char_traits<CharT>,
       class Allocator = std::allocator<CharT>
   > class basic_osyncstream : public std::basic_ostream<CharT, Traits>
                                 (since C++20)

   The class template std::basic_osyncstream is a convenience wrapper for
   std::basic_syncbuf. It provides a mechanism to synchronize threads
   writing to the same stream.

   It can be used with a named variable:
{
    std::osyncstream synced_out(std::cout); // synchronized wrapper for std::cou
t
    synced_out << "Hello, ";
    synced_out << "World!";
    synced_out << std::endl; // flush is noted, but not yet performed
    synced_out << "and more!\n";
} // characters are transferred and std::cout is flushed

   as well as with a temporary:
std::osyncstream(std::cout) << "Hello, " << "World!" << '\n';

   It provides the guarantee that all output made to the same final
   destination buffer (std::cout in the examples above) will be free of
   data races and will not be interleaved or garbled in any way, as long
   as every write to that final destination buffer is made through
   (possibly different) instances of std::basic_osyncstream.

   Typical implementation of std::basic_osyncstream holds only one member:
   the wrapped std::basic_syncbuf.
